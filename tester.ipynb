In theory. In practice, doing so requires having a large set of parallel sentencealigned bi-lingual texts (a bi-text) for that language pair, which is often unavailable. Large highquality bi-texts are rare; except for Arabic, Chinese, and some official languages of the European Union (EU), most of the 6,500+ world languages remain resource-poor from an SMT viewpoint. While manually creating a small bi-text could be relatively easy, building a large one is hard, e.g., because of copyright. Most bi-texts for SMT come from parliament debates and legislation of multi-lingual countries (e.g., French-English from Canada, and Chinese-English from Hong Kong), or from international organizations like the United Nations and the European Union. For example, the Europarl corpus of parliament proceedings consists of about 1.3M parallel sentences (up to 44M words) per language for 11 languages (Koehn, 2005), and the JRC-Acquis corpus provides a comparable amount of European legislation in 22 languages (Steinberger et al, 2006). The official languages of the EU are especially lucky in that respect; while this includes such ?classic SMT languages? like English and French, and some important international ones like Spanish and Portuguese, most of the rest have a limited number of speakers and were resource-poor until recently; this is changing quickly because of the increasing volume of EU parliament debates and the ever-growing European legislation. Thus, becoming an official language of the EU has turned out to be an easy recipe for getting resource-rich in bi-texts quickly. Of course, not all languages are that ?lucky?, but many can still benefit. In this paper, we propose using bi-texts for resource-rich language pairs to build better SMT systems for resource-poor ones by exploiting the similarity between a resource-poor language and a resource-rich one. The proposed method allows non-EU languages to benefit from being closely related to one or more official languages of the EU, the most obvious candidates being Norwegian (related to Swedish), Moldavian 1 (related to Romanian), and Macedonian 2 (related to Bulgarian). After Croatia joins the EU, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin will be able to benefit from Croatian gradually turning resource-rich (all four split from SerboCroatian after the breakup of Yugoslavia). The newly-made EU-official (and thus not as resource1 Not recognized by Romania. 2 Not recognized by Bulgaria and Greece. 1358 rich) Czech and Slovak are another possible pair of candidates. As we will see below, even such resource-rich languages like Spanish and Portuguese can benefit from the proposed method. Of course, many pairs of closely related languages can be also found outside of Europe, Malay and Indonesian being just one such example we will experiment with. The remainder of the present paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents our method, Section 3 describes the experiments, and Section 4 discusses the results and the general applicability of the approach.Section 5 provides an overview of the related work. Finally, Section 6 concludes and suggests possible directions for future work. 2 Method We propose a novel language-independent approach for improving statistical machine translation for resource-poor languages by exploiting their similarity to resource-rich ones. More precisely, we improve the translation from a resourcepoor source language X 1 into a resource-rich target language Y given a bi-text containing a limited number of parallel sentences forX 1 -Y and a much larger bi-text forX 2 -Y for some resource-rich language X 2 that is closely related to X 1 . Our method exploits the similarity between related languages with respect to word order, syntax, and, most importantly, vocabulary overlap ? related languages share a large number of cognates. Before we present the method, we will describe two simple strategies for integrating the bi-text for X 2 -Y into a phrase-based SMT system for X 1 -Y . 2.1 Merging Bi-texts We can simply concatenate the bi-texts for X 1 -Y and X 2 -Y into one large bi-text and use it to train an SMT system. This offers several advantages. First, it can yield improved word alignments for the sentences that came from the X 1 -Y bi-text, e.g., since the additional sentences can provide new contexts for the rare words in that bi-text; rare words are hard to align, which could have a disastrous effect on the subsequent phrase extraction stage. Second, it can provide new source-language side translation options, thus increasing the lexical coverage and reducing the number of unknown words at translation time; it can also provide new useful non-compositional phrases on the sourcelanguage side, thus yielding more fluent translation output. Third, it can offer new target-language side phrases for known source phrases, which could improve fluency by providing more translation options for the language model (LM) to choose from. Fourth, bad phrases including words from X 2 that do not exist in X 1 will be effectively ignored at translation time since they could never possibly match the input, while bad new targetlanguage translations still have the chance to be filtered out by the language model. However, simple concatenation can be problematic. First, when concatenating the small bi-text for X 1 -Y with the much larger one for X 2 -Y , the latter will dominate during word alignment and phrase extraction, thus hugely influencing both lexical and phrase translation probabilities, which can yield poor performance. This can be counteracted by repeating the small bi-text several times so that the large one does not dominate. Second, since the bi-texts are merged mechanically, there is no way to distinguish between phrases extracted from the bi-text for X 1 -Y (which should be good), from those coming from the bi-text for X 2 -Y (whose quality might be questionable). 2.2 Combining Phrase Tables An alternative way of making use of the additional bi-text for X 2 -Y to train an improved SMT system for X 1 ? Y is to build separate phrase tables from X 1 -Y and X 2 -Y ,which can then be (a) used together, e.g., as alternative decoding paths, (b) merged, e.g., using one or more extra features to indicate the bi-text each phrase came from, or (c) interpolated, e.g., using simple linear interpolation. Building two separate phrase tables offers several advantages. First, the good phrases from the bi-text forX 1 -Y are clearly distinguished from (or given a higher weight in the linear interpolation compared to) the potentially bad ones from the X 2 -Y bi-text. Second, the lexical and the phrase translation probabilities are combined in a principled manner. Third, using an X 2 -Y bi-text that is much larger than that for X 1 -Y is not problematic any more. Fourth, as with bi-text merging, there are many additional source- and target-language phrases, which offer new translation options. On the negative side, the opportunity is lost to obtain improved word alignments for the sentences in the X 1 -Y bi-text. 1359 2.3 Proposed Method Taking into account the potential advantages and disadvantages of the above strategies, we propose a method that tries to get the best of both: (i) increased lexical coverage by using additional phrase pairs independently extracted from X 2 -Y , and (ii) improved word alignments for X 1 -Y by biasing the word alignment process with additional sentence pairs from X 2 -Y (possibly also repeating X 1 -Y several times). A detailed description of the method follows: 1. Build a bi-text B cat that is a concatenation of the bi-texts for X 1 -Y and X 2 -Y . Generate word alignments forB cat , extract phrases, and build a phrase table T cat . 2. Build a bi-text B rep from the X 1 -Y bi-text repeated k times followed by one copy of the X 2 -Y bi-text. Generate word alignments for B rep , then truncate them, only keeping word alignments for one copy of the X 1 -Y bi-text. Use these word alignments to extract phrases, and build a phrase table T rep trunc . 3. Produce a phrase table T merged by combining T cat and T rep trunc , giving priority to the latter, and use it in an X 1 ? Y SMT system. 2.4 Transliteration As we mentioned above, our method relies on the existence of a large number of cognates between related languages. While linguists define cognates as words derived from a common root 3 (Bickford and Tuggy, 2002), computational linguists typically ignore origin, defining them as words in different languages that are mutual translations and have a similar orthography (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Melamed, 1999). In this paper, we adopt the latter definition. Cognates between related languages often exhibit minor spelling variations, which can be simply due to different rules of orthography, (e.g., senhor vs. se?nor in Portuguese and Spanish), but often stem from real phonological differences. For example, the Portuguese suffix -c??ao corresponds to the Spanish suffix -ci?on, e.g., evoluc??ao vs. evoluci?on. Such correspondences can be quite frequent and thus easy to learn automatically 4 .Even 3 E.g., Latin tu, Old English thou, Spanish t?u, Greek s?u and German du are all cognates meaning ?2 nd person singular?. 4 Not all such differences are systematic; many apply to a particular word only, e.g., kerana vs. karena in Malay and Indonesian, or dizer vs. decir in Portuguese and Spanish. more frequent can be the inflectional variations. For example, in Portuguese and Spanish respectively, verb endings like -ou vs. -?o (for 3rd person singular, simple past tense), e.g., visitou vs. visit?o, or -ei vs. -?e (for 1st person singular, simple past tense), e.g., visitei vs. visit?e. If such systematic differences exist between the languages X 1 and X 2 , it might be useful to learn and to use them as a pre-processing step in order to transliterate the X 2 side of the X 2 -Y bi-text and thus increase its vocabulary overlap with the source language X 1 . We will describe our approach to automatic transliteration in more detail in Section 3.4 below. 3 Experiments 3.1 Language Pairs We experimented with two language pairs: the closely relatedMalay and Indonesian and the more dissimilar Spanish and Portuguese. Malay and Indonesian are mutually intelligible, but differ in pronunciation and vocabulary. An example follows 5 : ? Malay: Semua manusia dilahirkan bebas dan samarata dari segi kemuliaan dan hakhak. ? Indonesian: Semua orang dilahirkan merdeka dan mempunyai martabat dan hak-hak yang sama. Spanish and Portuguese also exhibit a noticeable degree of mutual intelligibility, but differ in pronunciation, spelling, and vocabulary. Unlike Malay and Indonesian, however, they also differ syntactically and have a high degree of spelling differences as demonstrated by the following examples 6 : ? Spanish: Se?nora Presidenta, estimados colegas, lo que est?a sucediendo en Oriente Medio es una tragedia. ? Portuguese: Senhora Presidente, caros colegas, o que est?a a acontecer no Medio Oriente ?e uma trag?edia. 5 In English: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. (from Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) 6 In English: Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the events in the Middle East are a real tragedy. 1360 3.2 Datasets In our experiments, we used the following number of training sentence pairs (number of words shown in parentheses) for English (en), Indonesian (in), Malay (ml), Portuguese(pt), and Spanish (es): ? Indonesian-English (in-en): ? 28,383 pairs (0.8M, 0.9M words); ? monolingual English en in : 5.1M words. ? Malay-English (ml-en): ? 190,503 pairs (5.4M, 5.8M words); ? monoling. English en ml : 27.9M words. ? Spanish-English (es-en): ? 1,240,518 pairs (35.7M, 34.6M words); ? monolingual English en es:pt : 45.3M words (the same as for pt-en). ? Portuguese-English (pt-en): ? 1,230,038 pairs (35.9M, 34.6M words). ? monolingual English en es:pt : 45.3M words (the same as for es-en). All of the above datasets contain sentences with up to 100 tokens. In addition, for each of the four language pairs, we have a development and a testing bi-text, each with 2,000 parallel sentence pairs. We made sure the development and the testing bi-texts shared no sentences withthe training bi-texts; we further excluded from the monolingual English data all sentences from the English sides of the training and the development bi-texts. The training bi-text datasets for es-en and pt-en were built from release v.3 of the Europarl corpus, excluding the Q4/2000 portion out of which we created our testing and development datasets. We built the in-en bi-texts from texts that we downloaded from the Web. We translated the Indonesian texts to English using Google Translate, and we matched 7 them against the English texts using a cosine similarity measure and heuristic constraints based on document length in words and in sentences, overlap of numbers, words in uppercase, and words in the title. Next, we extracted pairs of sentences from the matched document pairs using competitive linking (Melamed, 2000), and we retained the ones whose similarity was above a pre-specified threshold. The ml-en was built in a similar manner. 7 Note that the automatic translations were used for matching only; the final bi-text contained no automatic translations. 3.3 Baseline SMT System In the baseline, we used the following setup: We first tokenized and lowercased both sides of the training bi-text. We then built separate directed word alignments for English?X andX?English (X?{Indonesian, Spanish}) using IBM model 4 (Brown et al, 1993), combined them using the intersect+grow heuristic (Och and Ney, 2003), and extracted phrase-level translation pairs of maximum length seven using the alignment template approach (Och and Ney, 2004). We thus obtained a phrase table where each pair is associated with five parameters: forward and reverse phrase translation probabilities, forward and reverse lexical translation probabilities, and phrase penalty. We then trained a log-linear model using standard SMT feature functions: trigram language model probability, word penalty, distance-based 8 distortion cost, and the parameters from the phrase table. We set al weights by optimizing Bleu (Papineni et al, 2002) using minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) on a separate development set of 2,000 sentences (Indonesian or Spanish), and we used them in a beam search decoder (Koehn et al, 2007) to translate 2,000 test sentences (Indonesian or Spanish) into English. Finally, we detokenized the output, and we evaluated it against a lowercased gold standard using Bleu 9 . 3.4 Transliteration As was mentioned in Section 2, transliteration can be helpful for languages with regular spelling differences. Thus, we built a system for transliteration from Portuguese into Spanish that was trained on a list of automatically extracted likely cognates. The system was applied on the Portuguese side of the pt-en training bi-text. Classic approaches to automatic cognate extraction look for non-stopwords with similar spelling that appear in parallel sentences in a bi-text (Kondrak et al, 2003). In our case, however, we need to extract cognates between Spanish and Portuguese given pt-en and es-en bi-texts only, i.e., without having a pt-es bi-text. Although it is easy to construct a pt-es bi-text from the Europarl corpus, we chose not to do so since, in general, synthe8 We also tried lexicalized reordering (Koehn et al, 2005). While it yielded higher absolute Bleu scores, the relative improvementfor a sample of our experiments was very similar to that achieved with distance-based re-ordering. 9 We used version 11b of the NIST scoring tool: http://www.nist.gov/speech/tools/ 1361 sizing a bi-text for X 1 -X 2 would be impossible: e.g., it cannot be done for ml-in given our training datasets for in-en andml-en since the English sides of these bi-texts have no sentences in common. Thus, we extracted the list of likely cognates between Portuguese and Spanish from the training pt-en and es-en bi-texts using English as a pivot as follows: We started with IBM model 4 word alignments, from which we extracted four conditional lexical translation probabilities: Pr(p j |e i ) and Pr(e i |p j ) for Portuguese-English, and Pr(s k |e i ) and Pr(e i |s k ) for Spanish-English, where p j , e i and s k stand for a Portuguese, an English and a Spanish word respectively. Following Wu and Wang (2007), we then induced conditional lexical translation probabilities Pr(p j |s k ) and Pr(s k |p j ) for Portuguese-Spanish as follows: Pr(p j |s k ) = ? i Pr(p j |e i , s k )Pr(e i |s k ) Assuming p j is conditionally independent of s k given e i , we can simplify the above expression: Pr(p j |s k ) = ? i Pr(p j |e i )Pr(e i |s k ) Similarly, for Pr(s k |p j ), we obtain Pr(s k |p j ) = ? i Pr(s k |e i )Pr(e i |p j ) We excluded all stopwords, words of length less than three, and those containing digits. We further calculated Prod(p j , s k ) = Pr(p j |s k )Pr(s k |p j ), and we excluded all Portuguese-Spanish word pairs (p j , s k ) for which Prod(p j , s k ) &lt; 0.01. From the remaining pairs, we extracted likely cognates based on Prod(p j , s k ) and on the orthographic similarity between p j and s k . Following Melamed (1995), we measured the orthographic similarity using the longest common subsequence ratio (LCSR), defined as follows: LCSR(s 1 , s 2 ) = |LCS(s 1 ,s 2 )| max(|s 1 |,|s 2 |) where LCS(s 1 , s 2 ) is the longest common subsequence of s 1 and s 2 , and |s| is the length of s. We retained as likely cognates all pairs for which LCSR was 0.58 or higher; that value was found by Kondrak et al (2003) to be optimal for a number of language pairs in the Europarl corpus. Finally, we performed competitive linking (Melamed, 2000), assuming that each Portuguese wordform had at most one Spanish best cognate match. Thus, using the values of Prod(p j , s k ), we induced a fully-connected weighted bipartite graph. Then, we performed a greedy approximation to the maximum weighted bipartite matching in that graph (i.e., competitive linking) as follows: First, we accepted as cognates the crosslingual pair (p j, s k ) with the highest Prod(p j , s k ) in the graph, and we discarded p j and s k from further consideration. Then, we accepted the next highest-scored pair, and we discarded the involved wordforms and so forth. The process was repeated until there were no matchable pairs left. As a result of the above procedure, we ended up with 28,725 Portuguese-Spanish cognate pairs, 9,201 (or 32%) of which had spelling differences. For each pair in the list of cognate pairs, we added spaces between any two adjacent letters for both wordforms, and we further appended the start and the end characters ? and $. For example, the cognate pair evoluc??ao ? evoluci?on became ? e v o l u c? ?a o $ ? ? e v o l u c i ?o n $ We randomly split the resulting list into a training (26,725 pairs) and a development dataset (2,000 pairs), and trained and tuned a characterlevel phrase-based monotone SMT system similar to (Finch and Sumita, 2008) to transliterate a Portuguese wordform into a Spanish wordform. We used a Spanish language model trained on 14M word tokens (obtained from the above-mentioned 45.3M-token monolingual English corpus after excluding punctuation, stopwords, words of length less than three, and those containing digits): one per line and character-separated with added start and end characters as in the above example. We set both the maximum phrase length and the language model order to ten; this value was found by tuning on the development dataset. The system was tuned using MERT, and the feature weights were saved. The tuning Bleu was 95.22%, while the baseline Bleu, for leaving the Portuguese words intact, was 87.63%. Finally, the training and the tuning datasets were merged, and a new training round was performed. The resulting system was used with the saved feature weights to transliterate the Portuguese side of the training pt-en bi-text, which yielded a new pt es -en training bi-text. We did the same for Malay into Indonesian. We extracted 5,847 cognate pairs, 844 (or 14.4%) of which had spelling differences, and we trained a transliteration system. The highest tuning Bleu was 95.18% (for maximum phrase size and LM order of 10), but the baseline was 93.15%. We then re-trained the system on the combination of the training and the development datasets, and we transliterated the Malay side of the training ml-en bi-text, obtaining a new ml in -en training bi-text. 1362 # Train LM Dev Test 10K 20K 40K 80K 160K 320K 640K 1230K 1 ml-en en ml ml-en ml-en 44.93 46.98 47.15 48.04 49.01 ? ? ? 2 ml in -en en ml ml-en ml-en 38.99 40.96 41.02 41.88 42.81 ? ? ? 3 ml-en en ml ml-en in-en 13.69 14.58 14.76 15.12 15.84 ? ? ? 4 ml-en en ml in-en in-en 13.98 14.75 14.91 15.51 16.27 ? ? ? 5 ml-en en in in-en in-en 15.56 16.38 16.52 17.04 17.90 ? ? ? 6 ml in -en en in in-en in-en 16.44 17.36 17.62 18.14 19.15 ? ?? 7 pt-en en es:pt pt-en pt-en 21.28 23.11 24.43 25.72 26.43 27.10 27.78 27.96 8 pt es -en en es:pt pt-en pt-en 10.91 11.56 12.16 12.50 12.83 13.27 13.48 13.71 9 pt-en en es:pt pt-en es-en 4.40 4.77 4.57 5.02 4.99 5.32 5.08 5.34 10 pt-en en es:pt es-en es-en 4.91 5.12 5.64 5.82 6.35 6.87 6.44 7.10 11 pt es -en en es:pt es-en es-en 8.18 9.03 9.97 10.66 11.35 12.26 12.69 13.79 Table 1: Cross-lingual SMT experiments (shown in bold). Columns 2-5 present the bi-texts used for training, development and testing, and the monolingual data used to train the English language model. The following columns show the resulting Bleu (in %s) for different numbers of training sentence pairs. 3.5 Cross-lingual Translation In this subsection, we study the similarity between the original and the additional source languages. First, we measured the vocabulary overlap between Spanish and Portuguese, which was feasible since our training pt-en and es-en bi-texts are from the same time span in the Europarl corpus and their English sides largely overlap. We found 110,053 Portuguese and 121,444 Spanish word types, and 44,461 (or 36.6%) of them were identical. Unfortunately, we could not do the same for Malay and Indonesian since the English sides of the in-en and ml-en bi-texts do not overlap. Second, following the setup of the baseline system, we performed cross-lingual experiments. The results are shown in Table 1. As we can see, this yielded a huge decrease in Bleu compared to the baseline ? three to five times ? even for very large training datasets, and even when a proper English LM and development dataset were used: compare line 1 to lines 3-6, and line 7 to lines 9-11. Third, we tried transliteration. Bleu doubled for Spanish (see lines 10-11), but improved far less for Indonesian (lines 5-6). Training on the transliterated data and testing on Malay and Portuguese yielded about 10-12% relative decrease for Malay (lines 1-2) but 50% for Portuguese (lines 78). 10 Thus, unlike Spanish and Portuguese, there were far less systematic spelling variations between Malay and Indonesian. A closer inspection confirmed this: many extracted likely MalayIndonesian cognate pairs with spelling differences were in fact forms of a word existing in both languages, e.g., kata and berkata (?to say?). 10 However, as lines 8 and 11 show, a system trained on 1.23M pt es -en sentence pairs, performs equally well when translating Portuguese and Spanish text: 13.71% vs. 13.79%. 3.6 Using an Additional Language We performed various experiments combining the original and an additional training bi-text: Two-tables: We built two separate phrase tables for the two bi-texts, and we used them in the alternative decoding path model of Birch et al (2007). Interpolation: We built two separate phrase tables for the original and for the additional bitext, and we used linear interpolation to combine the corresponding conditional probabilities: Pr(e|s) = ?Pr orig (e|s) + (1 ? ?)Pr extra (e|s). We optimized the value of ? on the development dataset, trying .5, .6, .7, .8 and .9; we used the same ? forall four conditional probabilities. Merge: We built separate phrase tables, T orig and T extra , for the original and for the additional training bi-text. We then concatenated them giving priority to T orig : We kept all phrase pairs from T orig , adding to them those ones from T extra that were not present in T orig . For each phrase pair added, we retained its associated conditional probabilities and the phrase penalty. We further added three additional features to each entry in the new table: F 1 , F 2 and F 3 . The value of F 1 was 1 if the phrase pair came from T orig , and 0.5 otherwise. Similarly, F 2 =1 if the phrase pair came from T extra , and F 2 =0.5 otherwise. The value of F 3 was 1 if the pair came from both T orig and T extra , and 0.5 otherwise. We experimented using (1) F 1 only, (2) F 1 and F 2 , (3) F 1 , F 2 , and F 3 . We set all feature weights using MERT, and we optimized the number of features on the development set. 11 11 In theory, we should have also re-normalized the probabilities since they may not sum to one. In practice, this was not that important since the log-linear SMT model does not require that the features be probabilities at all (e.g., the phrase penalty), and we had extra features whose impact was bigger. 1363 Concat?k: We concatenated k copies of the original and one copy of the additional training bitext; we then trained and tuned an SMT system as for the baseline. The value for k was optimized on the development dataset. Concat?k:align: We concatenated k copies of the original and one copy of the additional training bi-text. We then generated IBM model 4 word alignments, and we truncated them, only keeping them for one copy of the original training bi-text. Next, we extracted phrase pairs, thus buildng a phrase table, and we tuned an SMT system as for the baseline. Our Method: Our method was described in Section 2. We used merge to combine the phrase tables for concat?k:align and concat?1, considering the former as T orig and the latter as T extra . We had two parameters to tune: k and the number of extra features in the merged phrase table. Figure 1: Impact of k on Bleu for concat?k for different number of extra ml-en sentence pairs in Indonesian?English SMT. 4 Results and Discussion First, we studied the impact of k on concat?k for Indonesian?English SMT using Malay as an additional language. We tried all values of k such that 1?k?16 with 10000n extra ml-en sentence pairs, n?{1,2,4,8,16}. As we can see in Figure 1, the highest Bleu scores are achieved for (n; k)?{(1;2),(2;2),(4;4),(8;7),(16;16)}, i.e., when k ? n. In order to limit the search space, we used this relationship between k and n in our experiments (also for Portuguese and Spanish). Table 2 shows the results for experiments onimproving Indonesian?English SMT using 10K, 20K, . . ., 160K additional ml-en pairs of parallel sentences. Several observations can be made. First, using more additional sentences yields better results. Second, with one exception, all experiments yield improvements over the baseline. Third, the improvements are always statistically significant for our method, according to (Collins et al, 2005)?s sign test. Overall, among the different bi-text combination strategies, our method performs best, followed by concat?k, merge, and interpolate, which are very close in performance; these three strategies are the only ones to consistently yield higher Bleu as the number of additional ml-en sentence pairs grows. Methods like concat?1, concat?k:align and two-tables are somewhat inconsistent in that respect. The latter method performs worst and is the only one to go below the baseline (for 10K ml-en pairs). Table 3 shows the results when using pt-en data to improve Spanish?English SMT. Overall, the results and the conclusions that can be made are consistent with those for Table 2. We can further observe that, as the size of the original bi-text increases, the gain in Bleu decreases, which is to be expected. Note also that here transliteration is very important: it doubles the absolute gain in Bleu. Finally, Table 4 shows a comparison to the pivoting technique of Callison-Burch et al (2006). for English?Spanish SMT. Despite using just Portuguese, we achieve an improvement that is, in five out of six cases, much better than what they achieve with eight pivot languages (which include not only Portuguese, but also two other Romance languages, French and Italian, which are closely related to Spanish). Moreover, our method yields improvements for very large original datasets ? 1.2M pairs, while theirs stops improving at 160K. However, our improvements are only statistically significant for 160K original pairs or less. Finally, note that our translation direction is reversed. Based on the experimental results, we can make several conclusions. First, we have shown that using bi-text data from related languages improves SMT: we achieved up to 1.35 and 3.37 improvement in Bleu for in-en (+ml-en) and es-en (+pten) respectively. Second, while simple concatenation can help, it is problematic when the additional sentences out-number the ones from the original bi-text. Third, concatenation can work very well if the original bi-text is repeated enough times so that the additional bi-text does not dominate. Fourth, merging phrase tables giving priority to the original bi-text and using additional fea1364 in-en ml-en Baseline Two tables Interpol.

Fifth, part of the improvement when combining bi-texts is due to increased vocabulary coverage because of cognates, but another part comes from improved word alignments. Sixth, the best results are achieved when the latter two sources are first isolated and then combined (our method). Finally, transliteration can help a lot in case of systematic spelling variations between the original and the additional source languages. 5 RelatedWork In this section, we describe two general lines of related previous research: using cognates between the source and the target language, and sourcelanguage side paraphrasing with a pivot language. 5.1 Cognates Many researchers have used likely cognates to obtain improved word alignments and thus build better SMT systems. Al-Onaizan et al (1999) extracted such likely cognates for Czech-English using one of the variations of LCSR (Melamed, 1995) described in (Tiedemann, 1999) as a similarity measure. They used these cognates to improve word alignments with IBM models 1-4 in three different ways: (1) by seeding the parameters of IBM model 1, (2) by constraining the word cooccurrences when training IBM models 1-4, and (3) by adding the cognate pairs to the bi-text as additional ?sentence pairs?. The last approach performed best and was later used by Kondrak et al (2003) who demonstrated improved SMT for nine European languages. Unlike these approaches, which extract cognates between the source and the target language, we use cognates between the source and some other related language that is different from the target. Moreover, we only implicitly rely on the existence of such cognates; we do not try to extract them at all, and we leave them in their original sentence contexts. 12 12 However, in some of our experiments, we extract cognates for training a transliteration system from the resourcerich source language X 2 into the resource-poor one X 1 . 1365 Direction System 10K 20K 40K 80K 160K 320K 1,230K en?es baseline 22.6 25.0 26.5 26.5 28.7 30.0 ? pivoting (+8 languages ? ?1.3M pairs) 23.3 26.0 27.2 28.0 29.0 30.0 ? improvement +0.7 +1.0 +0.7 +1.5 +0.3 +0.0 ? es?en baseline 22.87 24.71 25.80 27.08 27.90 28.46 29.90 our method (+1 language ? 160K pairs) 23.98 ? 25.65 ? 26.49 ? 27.30 \\x05 28.05 28.52 29.87 improvement +1.11 ? +0.94 ? +0.69 ? +0.22 \\x05 +0.15 +0.06 -0.03 our method (translit., +1 lang. ? 160K) 25.73 ? 26.36 ? 26.95 ? 27.49 ? 28.16 28.43 29.94 improvement +2.86 ? +1.65 ? +1.15 ? +0.41 ? +0.26 -0.03 +0.04 our method (+1 language ? 1.23M pairs) 24.23 ? 25.70 ? 26.78 ? 27.49 28.22 \\x05 28.58 29.84 improvement +1.36 ? +0.99 ? +0.98 ? +0.41 +0.32 \\x05 +0.12 -0.06 our method (translit., +1 lang. ? 1.23M) 26.24 ? 26.82 ? 27.47 ? 27.85 ? 28.50 ? 28.70 29.99 improvement +3.37 ? +2.11 ? +1.67 ? +0.77 ? +0.60 ? +0.24 +0.09 Table 4: Comparison to the pivoting technique of Callison-Burch et al (2006) for English?Spanish.

Statistically significant improvements over the baseline are marked with a ? (for p &lt; 0.01) and with a \\x05 (for p &lt; 0.05). 5.2 Paraphrasing with aPivot-Language Another relevant line of research is on using multilingual parallel corpora to improve SMT using additional languages as pivots. Callison-Burch et al (2006) improved English?Spanish and English?French SMT using source-language paraphrases extracted with the pivoting technique of Bannard and CallisonBurch (2005) and eight additional languages from the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005). For example, using German as a pivot, they extracted English paraphrases from a parallel English-German corpus by looking for English phrases that were aligned to the same German phrase: e.g., if under control and in check were aligned to unter controlle, they were hypothesized to be paraphrases with some probability. Such (English) paraphrases were added as additional entries in the phrase table of an English?Spanish/English?French phrase-based SMT system and paired with the foreign (Spanish/French) translation of the original (English) phrase. The system was then tuned with MERT using an extra feature penalizing low-probability paraphrases; this yielded up to 1.8% absolute improvement in Bleu. Other important publications about pivoting approaches for machine translation include (Wu and Wang, 2007), (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007), (Haji?c et al, 2000) and (Habash and Hu, 2009). Unlike pivoting, which can only improve source-language lexical coverage, we augment both the source- and the target-language sides. Second, while pivoting ignores context when extracting paraphrases, we take it into account. Third, by using as an additional language one that is related to the source, we are able to get increase in Bleu that is comparable and even better than what pivoting achieves with eight pivot languages. On the negative side, our approach is limited in that it requires that X 2 be related to X 1 , while the pivoting language Z does not need to be related to X 1 nor to Y . However, we only need one additional parallel corpus (for X 2 -Y ), while pivoting needs two: one for X 1 -Z and one for Z-Y . Finally, note that our approach is orthogonal to pivoting, and thus the two can be combined. 6 Conclusion and Future Work We have proposed a novel method for improving SMT for resource-poor languages by exploiting their similarity to resource-rich ones. In future work, we would like to extend that approach in several interesting directions. First, we want to make better use of multi-lingual parallel corpora, e.g., while we had access to a SpanishPortuguese-English corpus, we used it as two separate bi-texts Spanish-English and PortugueseEnglish. Second, we would like to exploit multiple auxiliary resource-rich languages the resourcepoor source language is related to. Third, we could also experiment with using auxiliary languages that are related to the target language. Acknowledgments This research was supported by research grant POD0713875. 1366'</th>\n",
       "      <th>b'Introduction  Although the field of machine translation has a  very long history, the number of really successful  systems is not very impressive. Most of the funds  invested into the development of various MT  systems have been wasted and have not  stimulated a development of techniques which  would allow to translate at least technical texts  from a certain limited domain. There were, of  course, exceptions, which demonstrated that  under certain conditions it is possible to develop  a system which will save money and efforts  invested into human translation. The main reason  why the field of MT has not met the expectations  of sci-fi literature, but also the expectations of  scientific community, is the complexity of the  task itself. A successful automatic translation  system requires an application of techniques from  several areas of computational inguistics  (morphology, syntax, semantics, discourse  analysis etc.) as a necessary, but not a sufficient  condition. The general opinion is that it is easier  to create an MT system for a pair of related  languages. In our contribution we would like to  demonstrate hat this assumption holds only for  really very closely related languages.  1. Czech-to-Russian MT system RUSLAN  1.1 History  The first attempt o verify the hypothesis that  related languages are easier to translate started in  mid 80s at Charles University in Prague. The  project was called RUSLAN and aimed at the  translation of documentation i the domain of  operating systems for mainframe computers. It  was developed in cooperation with the Research  Institute of Mathematical Machines in Prague. At  that time in former COMECON countries it was  obligatory to translate any kind of documentation  to such systems into Russian. The work on the  Czech-to-Russian MT system RUSLAN (cf. Oliva  (1989)) started in 1985. It was terminated in 1990  (with COMECON gone) for the lack of funding.  1.2 System description  The system was rule-based, implemented in  Colmerauer\\'s Q-systems. It contained a full-  fledged morphological and syntactic analysis of  Czech, a transfer and a syntactic and  morphological generation of Russian. There was  almost no transfer at the beginning of the project  due to the assumption that both languages are  similar to the extent that does not require any  transfer phase at all. This assumption turned to be  wrong and several phenomena were covered by  the transfer in the later stage of the project (for  example the translation of the Czech verb \"b~\"  \\\\[to be\\\\] into one of the three possible Russian  equivalents: empty form, the form \"byt6\" in future  7  tense and the verb \"javljat6sja\"; or the translation  of verbal negation).  At the time when the work was terminated in  1990, the system had a main translation  dictionary of about 8000 words, accompanied by  so called transducing dictionary coveringanother  2000 words. The transducing dictionary was  based on the original idea described in Kirschner  (1987). It aimed at the exploitation of the fact  that technical terms are based (in a majority of  European languages) on Greek or Latin stems,  adopted according to the particular derivational  rules of the given languages. This fact allows for  the \"translation\" of technical terms by means of a  direct transcription of productive ndings and a  slight (regular) adjustment of the spelling of the  stem. For example, the English words  localization and discrimination can be  transcribed into Czech as \"lokalizace\" and  \"diskriminace\" with a productive nding -ation  being transcribed to -ace. It was generally  assumed that for the pair Czech/Russian the  transducing dictionary would be able to profit  from a substantially greater number of productive  rules. This hypothesis proved to be wrong, too  (see B6mov~, Kubofi (1990)). The set of  productive ndings for both pairs (English/Czech,  as developed for an earlier MT system from  English to Czech, and Czech/Russian) was very  similar.  The evaluation of results of RUSLAN showed  that roughly 40% of input sentences were  translated correctly, about 40% with minor errors  correctable by a human post-editor and about  20% of the input required substantial editing or  re-translation. There were two main factors that  caused a deterioration of the translation. The first  factor was the incompleteness of the main  dictionary of the system. Even though the system  contained a set of so-called fail-soft rules, whose  task was to handle such situations, an unknown  word typically caused a failure of the module of   syntactic analysis, because the dictionary entries  contained - besides the translation equivalents  and morphological information - very important  syntactic information.  The second factor was the module of syntactic  analysis of Czech. There were several reasons of  parsing failures. Apart from the common inability  of most rule-based formal grammars to cover a  particular natural anguage to the finest detail of  its syntax there were other problems. One of  them  was the existence of non-projective constructions,  which are quite common in Czech even in  relatively short sentences. Even though they  account only for 1.7?/\\'o f syntactic dependencies,  every third Czech sentence contains at least one,  and in a news corpus, we discovered as much as  15 non-projective dependencies; see also Haji6 et  al. (1998). An example of a non-projective  construction is \"Soubor se nepodafilo otev~it.\"  \\\\[lit.: File Refl. was_not._possible to_open. - It was  not possible to open the file\\\\]. The formalism used  for the implementation (Q-systems) was not meant  to handle non-projective constructions. Another  source of trouble was the use of so-called  semantic features. These features were based on  lexical semantics of individual words. Their main  task was to support asemantically plausible  analysis and to block the implausible ones. It  turned out that the question of implausible  combinations of  semantic features is also more  complex than it was supposed to be. The practical  outcome of the use of semantic features was a  higher atio of parsing failures - semantic features  often blocked a plausible analysis. For example,  human lexicographers a signed the verb \\'to run\\' a  semantic feature stating that only a noun with  semantic features of a human or other living being  may be assigned the role of subject of this verb.  The input text was however full of sentences with  \\'programs\\' or \\'systems\\' running etc. It was of  course very easy to correct he semantic feature in  the dictionary, but the problem was that there  were far too many corrections required.  On the other hand, the fact that both languages  allow a high degree of word-order freedom  accounted for a certain simplification of  the  translation process. The grammar elied on the  fact that there are only minor word-order  differences between Czech and Russian.  1.3 Lessons learned  f rom RUSLAN  We have learned several lessons regarding the MT  of closely related languages:  ? The transfer-based approach provides a  similar quality of translation both for closely  related and typologically different languages  ? Two main bottlenecks of full-fledged  transfer-based systems are:  8  - complexity of the syntactic dictionary  - relative unreliability of the syntactic  analysis of the source language  Even a relatively simple component  (transducing dictionary) was equally complex  for English-to-Czech and Czech-to-Russian  translation  Limited text domains do not exist in real life,  it is necessary to work with a high coverage  dictionary at least for the source language.  2. Translation and localization  2.1 A pivot language  Localization of products and their documentation  is a great problem for any company, which wants  to strengthen its position on foreign language  market, especially for companies producing  various kinds of  software. The amounts of texts  being localized are huge and the localization  costs are huge as well.  It is quite clear that the localization from one  source language to several target languages,  which are typologically similar, but different  from the source language, is a waste of money  and effort. It is of course much easier to translate  texts from Czech to Polish or from Russian to  Bulgarian than from English or German to any of  these languages. There are several reasons, why  localization and translation is not being  performed through some pivot language,  representing a certain group of closely related  languages. Apart from political reasons the  translation through a pivot language has several  drawbacks. The most important one is the  problem of the loss of translation quality.Each  translation may to a certain extent shift the  meaning of the translated text and thus each  subsequent translation provides results more and  more different from the original. The second  most important reason is the lack of translators  from the pivot to the target language, while this is  usually no problem for the translation from the  source directly to the target language.  2.2 Translation memory is the key  The main goal of this paper is to suggest how to  overcome these obstacles by means of a  combination of an MT system with commercial  MAHT (Machine-aided human translation)  systems. We have chosen the TRADOS  Translator\\'s Workbench as a representative  system of a class of these products, which can be  characterized as an example-based translation  tools. IBM\\'s Translation Manager and other  products also belong to this class. Such systems  uses so-called translation memory, which contains  pairs of previously translated sentences from a  source to a target language. When a human  translator starts translating a new sentence, the  system tries to match the source with sentences  already stored in the translation memory. If it is  successful, it suggests the translation and the  human translator decides whether to use it, to  modify it or to reject it.  The segmentation f a translation memory is a key  feature for our system. The translation memory  may be exported into a text file and thus allows  easy manipulation with its content. Let us suppose  that we have at our disposal two translation  memories - one human made for the source/pivot  language pair and the other created by an MT  system for the pivot/target language pair. The  substitution of segments of a pivot language by  the segments of a target language is then only a  routine procedure. The human translator  translating from the source language to the target  language then gets a translation memory for the  required pair (source/target). The system of  penalties applied in TRADOS Translator\\'s  Workbench (or a similar system) guarantees that if  there is already a human-made translation present,  then it gets higher priority than the translation  obtained as a result of the automatic MT. This  system solves both problems mentioned above -  the human translators from the pivot to the target  language are not needed at all and the machine-  made translation memory serves only as a  resource supporting the direct human translation  from the source to the target language.  3. Mach ine  t rans lat ion of  (very) closely  related Slavic languages  In the group of Slavic languages, there are more  closely related languages than Czech and Russian.  Apart from the pair of Serbian and Croatian  languages, which are almost identical and were  9  considered one language just a few years ago,the  most closely related languages in this group are  Czech and Slovak.  This fact has led us to an experiment with  automatic translation between Czech and Slovak.  It was clear that application of a similar method  to that one used in the system RUSLAN would  lead to similar results. Due to the closeness of  both languages we have decided to apply a  simpler method. Our new system, (~ESILKO,  aims at a maximal exploitation of the similarity  of both languages. The system uses the method of  direct word-for-word translation, justified by the  similarity of syntactic constructions of both  languages.  Although the system is currently being tested on  texts from the domain of documentation to  corporate information systems, it is not limited to  any specific domain. Its primary task is, however,  to provide support for translation and localization  of various technical texts.  3.1 System (~ESiLKO  The greatest problem of the word-for-word  translation approach (for languages with very  similar syntax and word order, but different  morphological system) is the problem of  morphological ambiguity of individual word  forms. The type of ambiguity is slightly different  in languages with a rich inflection (majority of  Slavic languages) and in languages which do not  have such a wide variety of forms derived from a  single lemma. For example, in Czech there are  only rare cases of part-of-speech ambiguities ( t~t  \\\\[to stay/the state\\\\], zena \\\\[woman/chasing\\\\] or tri  \\\\[three/rub(imperative)\\\\]), much more frequent is  the ambiguity of gender, number and case (for  example, the form of the adjective jam\\\\[ \\\\[spring\\\\]  is 27-times ambiguous). The main problem is that  even though several Slavic languages have the  same property as Czech, the ambiguity is not  preserved. It is distributed in a different manner  and the \"form-for-form\" translation is not  applicable.  Without he analysis of at least nominal groups it  is often very difficult to solve this problem,  because for example the actual morphemic  categories of adjectives are in Czech  distinguishable only on the basis of gender,  number and case agreement between an adjective  and its governing noun. An alternative way to the  solution of this problem was the application of a  stochastically based morphological disambiguator  (morphological tagger) for Czech whose success  rate is close to 92?/\\'0. Our system therefore consists  of the following modules:  1. Import of the input from so-called \\'empty\\'  translation memory  2. Morphological analysis of Czech  3. Morphological disambiguation  4. Domain-related bilingual glossaries (incl.  single- and multiword terminology)  5. General bilingual dictionary  6. Morphological synthesis of Slovak  7. Export of the output o the original translation  memory  Letus now look in a more detail at the individual  modules of the system:  ad 1. The input text is extracted out of a  translationmemory previously exported into an  ASCII file. The exported translation memory (of  TRADOS) has a SGML-Iike notation with a  relatively simple structure (cf. the following  example):  Example 1. - A sample of the exported translation  memory  &lt;RTF Preamble&gt;...&lt;/RTF Preamble&gt;  &lt;TrU&gt;  &lt;CrD&gt;23051999  &lt;CrU&gt;VK  &lt;Seg L=CS_01&gt;Pomoci v~kazu ad-hoc m65ete  rychle a jednoduge vytv~i~et regerge.  &lt;Seg L=SK_01 &gt;n/a  &lt;/TrU&gt;  Our system uses only the segments marked by  &lt;Seg L=CS_01&gt;, which contain one source  language sentence ach, and &lt;Seg L=SK_01&gt;,  which is empty and which will later contain the  same sentence translated into the target language  by CESiLKO.  ad 2. The morphological analysis of Czech is  based on the morphological dictionary developed  by Jan Haji6 and Hana Skoumalov~i in 1988-99  (for latest description, see Haji~ (1998)). The  dictionary contains over 700 000 dictionary  entries and its typical coverage varies between  10  99% (novels) to 95% (technical texts). The  morphological analysis uses the system of  positional tags with 15 positions (each  morphological .category, such as Part-of-speech,  Number, Gender, Case, etc. has a fixed, single-  symbol place in the tag).  Example 2 - tags assigned to the word-form  \"pomoci\" (help/by means of)  pomoci:  NFP2 .... . .  A .... \\\\]NFS7 ...... A .... I R--2 . . . . . . . . . . .   where :  N - noun; R - preposition  F - feminine gender  S - singular, P - plural  7, 2 - case (7 - instrumental, 2 - genitive)  A - affirmative (non negative)  ad 3. The module of morphological  disambiguation is a key to the success of  the  translation. It gets an average number of 3.58  tags per token (word form in text) as an input.  The tagging system is purely statistical, and it  uses a log-linear model of probability distribution  - see Haji~, Hladkfi (1998). The learning is based  on a manually tagged corpus of Czech texts  (mostly from the general newspaper domain).  The system learns contextual rules (features)  automatically and also automatically determines  feature weights. The average accuracy of tagging  is between 91 and 93% and remains the same  even for technical texts (if we disregard the  unknown names and foreign-language t rms that  are not ambiguous anyway).  The lemmatization immediately follows tagging;  it chooses the first lemma with a possible tag  corresponding to the tag selected. Despite this  simple lemmatization method, and also thanks to  the fact that Czech words are rarely ambiguous in  their Part-of-speech, it works with an accuracy  exceeding 98%.  ad 4. The domain-related bilingual glossaries  contain pairs of individual words and pairs of  multiple-word terms. The glossaries are  organized into a hierarchy specified by the user;  typically, the glossaries for themost specific  domain are applied first. There is one general  matching rule for all levels of glossaries - the  longest match wins.  The multiple-word terms are sequences of lemmas  (not word forms). This structure has several  advantages, among others it allows to minimize  the size of the dictionary and also, due to the  simplicity of the structure, it allows modifications  of the glossaries by the linguistically naive user.  The necessary morphological information is  introduced into the domain-related glossary in an  off-line preprocessing stage, which does not  require user intervention. This makes a big  difference when compared to the RUSLAN  Czech-to-Russian MT system, when each  multiword dictionary entry cost about 30 minutes  of linguistic expert\\'s time on average.  ad 5. The main bilingual dictionary contains data  necessary for the translation of  both lemmas and  tags. The translation of tags (from the Czech into  the Slovak morphological system) is necessary,  because due to the morphological differences both  systems use close, but slightly different tagsets.  Currently the system handles the 1:1 translation of  tags (and 2:2, 3:3, etc.). Different ratio of  translation is very rare between Czech and Siovak,  but nevertheless an advanced system of dictionary  items is under construction (for the translation 1:2,  2:1 etc.). It is quite interesting that the lexically  homonymous words often preserve their  homonymy even after the translation, so no  special treatment of homonyms is deemed  necessary.  ad 6. The morphological synthesis of Slovak is  based on a monolingual dictionary of SIovak,  developed by J.Hric (1991-99), covering more  than \\\\]00,000 dictionary entries. The coverage of  the dictionary is not as high as of  the Czech one,  but it is still growing. It aims at a similar coverage  of Slovak as we enjoy for Czech.  ad 7. The export of  the output of the system  (~ESILKO into the translation memory (of  TRADOS Translator\\'s Workbench) amounts  mainly to cleaning of all irrelevant SGML  markers. The whole resulting Slovak sentence is  inserted into the appropriate location in the  original translation memory file. The following  example also shows that the marker &lt;CrU&gt;  contains an information that the target language  sentence was created by an MT system.  11  Example 3. -A  sample of the translation memory  containing the results of MT  &lt;RTF Preamble&gt;...&lt;/RTF Preamble&gt;  &lt;TrU&gt;  &lt;CRD&gt;23051999  &lt;CrU&gt;MT!  &lt;Seg L=CS_01&gt;Pomoci v~kazu ad-hoc mfi~ete  rychle a jednodu~e vytv~i~et re,erie.  &lt;Seg L=SK_01&gt;Pomoci v~kazov ad-hoc m6~ete  r~chio a jednoducho vytvhrat\\' re,erie.  &lt;/TrU&gt;  3.2 Evaluation of results  The problem how to evaluate results of automatic  translation is very difficult. For the evaluation of  our system we have exploited the close  connection between our system and the  TRADOS Translator\\'s Workbench. The method  is simple - the human translatoreceives the  translation memory created by our system and  translates the text using this memory. The  translator is free to make any changes to the text  proposed by the translation memory. The target  text created by a human translator is then  compared with the text created by the mechanical  application of translation memory to the source  text. TRADOS then evaluates the percentage of  matching in the same manner as it normally  evaluates the percentage of matching of source  text with sentences in translation memory. Our  system achieved about 90% match (as defined by  the TRADOS match module) with the results of  human translation, based on a relatively large  (more than 10,000 words) test sample. 4. Conclusions  The accuracy of the translation achieved by our  system justifies the hypothesis that word-for-  word translation might be a solution for MT of  really closely related languages. The remaining  problems to be solved are problems with the one-  to many or many-to-many translation, where the  lack of information in glossaries and dictionaries  sometimes causes an unnecessary translation  error.  The success of the system CESILKO has  encouraged the investigation of the possibility to  use the same method for other pairs of Slavic  languages, namely for Czech-to-Polish translation.  Although these languages are not so similar as  Czech and Slovak, we hope that an addition of a  simple partial noun phrase parsing might provide  results with the quality comparable to the full-  fledged syntactic analysis based system RUSLAN  (this is of course true also for the Czechoto-Slovak  translation). The first results of Czech-to Polish  translation are quite encouraging in this respect,  even though we could not perform as rigorous  testing as we did for Slovak.

       "  b'1 Introduction Recent developments in statistical machine translation (SMT), e.g., the availability of efficient implementations of integrated open-source toolkits like Moses (Koehn et al, 2007), have made it possible to build a prototype system with decent translation quality for any language pair in a few days or even hours. In theory. In practice, doing so requires having a large set of parallel sentencealigned bi-lingual texts (a bi-text) for that language pair, which is often unavailable. Large highquality bi-texts are rare; except for Arabic, Chinese, and some official languages of the European Union (EU), most of the 6,500+ world languages remain resource-poor from an SMT viewpoint. While manually creating a small bi-text could be relatively easy, building a large one is hard, e.g., because of copyright. Most bi-texts for SMT come from parliament debates and legislation of multi-lingual countries (e.g., French-English from Canada, and Chinese-English from Hong Kong), or from international organizations like the United Nations and the European Union. For example, the Europarl corpus of parliament proceedings consists of about 1.3M parallel sentences (up to 44M words) per language for 11 languages (Koehn, 2005), and the JRC-Acquis corpus provides a comparable amount of European legislation in 22 languages (Steinberger et al, 2006). The official languages of the EU are especially lucky in that respect; while this includes such ?classic SMT languages? like English and French, and some important international ones like Spanish and Portuguese, most of the rest have a limited number of speakers and were resource-poor until recently; this is changing quickly because of the increasing volume of EU parliament debates and the ever-growing European legislation. Thus, becoming an official language of the EU has turned out to be an easy recipe for getting resource-rich in bi-texts quickly. Of course, not all languages are that ?lucky?, but many can still benefit. In this paper, we propose using bi-texts for resource-rich language pairs to build better SMT systems for resource-poor ones by exploiting the similarity between a resource-poor language and a resource-rich one. The proposed method allows non-EU languages to benefit from being closely related to one or more official languages of the EU, the most obvious candidates being Norwegian (related to Swedish), Moldavian 1 (related to Romanian), and Macedonian 2 (related to Bulgarian). After Croatia joins the EU, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin will be able to benefit from Croatian gradually turning resource-rich (all four split from SerboCroatian after the breakup of Yugoslavia). The newly-made EU-official (and thus not as resource1 Not recognized by Romania. 2 Not recognized by Bulgaria and Greece. 1358 rich) Czech and Slovak are another possible pair of candidates. As we will see below, even such resource-rich languages like Spanish and Portuguese can benefit from the proposed method. Of course, many pairs of closely related languages can be also found outside of Europe, Malay and Indonesian being just one such example we will experiment with. The remainder of the present paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents our method, Section 3 describes the experiments, and Section 4 discusses the results and the general applicability of the approach.Section 5 provides an overview of the related work. Finally, Section 6 concludes and suggests possible directions for future work. 2 Method We propose a novel language-independent approach for improving statistical machine translation for resource-poor languages by exploiting their similarity to resource-rich ones. More precisely, we improve the translation from a resourcepoor source language X 1 into a resource-rich target language Y given a bi-text containing a limited number of parallel sentences forX 1 -Y and a much larger bi-text forX 2 -Y for some resource-rich language X 2 that is closely related to X 1 . Our method exploits the similarity between related languages with respect to word order, syntax, and, most importantly, vocabulary overlap ? related languages share a large number of cognates. Before we present the method, we will describe two simple strategies for integrating the bi-text for X 2 -Y into a phrase-based SMT system for X 1 -Y . 2.1 Merging Bi-texts We can simply concatenate the bi-texts for X 1 -Y and X 2 -Y into one large bi-text and use it to train an SMT system. This offers several advantages. First, it can yield improved word alignments for the sentences that came from the X 1 -Y bi-text, e.g., since the additional sentences can provide new contexts for the rare words in that bi-text; rare words are hard to align, which could have a disastrous effect on the subsequent phrase extraction stage. Second, it can provide new source-language side translation options, thus increasing the lexical coverage and reducing the number of unknown words at translation time; it can also provide new useful non-compositional phrases on the sourcelanguage side, thus yielding more fluent translation output. Third, it can offer new target-language side phrases for known source phrases, which could improve fluency by providing more translation options for the language model (LM) to choose from. Fourth, bad phrases including words from X 2 that do not exist in X 1 will be effectively ignored at translation time since they could never possibly match the input, while bad new targetlanguage translations still have the chance to be filtered out by the language model. However, simple concatenation can be problematic. First, when concatenating the small bi-text for X 1 -Y with the much larger one for X 2 -Y , the latter will dominate during word alignment and phrase extraction, thus hugely influencing both lexical and phrase translation probabilities, which can yield poor performance. This can be counteracted by repeating the small bi-text several times so that the large one does not dominate. Second, since the bi-texts are merged mechanically, there is no way to distinguish between phrases extracted from the bi-text for X 1 -Y (which should be good), from those coming from the bi-text for X 2 -Y (whose quality might be questionable). 2.2 Combining Phrase Tables An alternative way of making use of the additional bi-text for X 2 -Y to train an improved SMT system for X 1 ? Y is to build separate phrase tables from X 1 -Y and X 2 -Y ,which can then be (a) used together, e.g., as alternative decoding paths, (b) merged, e.g., using one or more extra features to indicate the bi-text each phrase came from, or (c) interpolated, e.g., using simple linear interpolation. Building two separate phrase tables offers several advantages. First, the good phrases from the bi-text forX 1 -Y are clearly distinguished from (or given a higher weight in the linear interpolation compared to) the potentially bad ones from the X 2 -Y bi-text. Second, the lexical and the phrase translation probabilities are combined in a principled manner. Third, using an X 2 -Y bi-text that is much larger than that for X 1 -Y is not problematic any more. Fourth, as with bi-text merging, there are many additional source- and target-language phrases, which offer new translation options. On the negative side, the opportunity is lost to obtain improved word alignments for the sentences in the X 1 -Y bi-text. 1359 2.3 Proposed Method Taking into account the potential advantages and disadvantages of the above strategies, we propose a method that tries to get the best of both: (i) increased lexical coverage by using additional phrase pairs independently extracted from X 2 -Y , and (ii) improved word alignments for X 1 -Y by biasing the word alignment process with additional sentence pairs from X 2 -Y (possibly also repeating X 1 -Y several times). A detailed description of the method follows: 1. Build a bi-text B cat that is a concatenation of the bi-texts for X 1 -Y and X 2 -Y . Generate word alignments forB cat , extract phrases, and build a phrase table T cat . 2. Build a bi-text B rep from the X 1 -Y bi-text repeated k times followed by one copy of the X 2 -Y bi-text. Generate word alignments for B rep , then truncate them, only keeping word alignments for one copy of the X 1 -Y bi-text. Use these word alignments to extract phrases, and build a phrase table T rep trunc . 3. Produce a phrase table T merged by combining T cat and T rep trunc , giving priority to the latter, and use it in an X 1 ? Y SMT system. 2.4 Transliteration As we mentioned above, our method relies on the existence of a large number of cognates between related languages. While linguists define cognates as words derived from a common root 3 (Bickford and Tuggy, 2002), computational linguists typically ignore origin, defining them as words in different languages that are mutual translations and have a similar orthography (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Melamed, 1999). In this paper, we adopt the latter definition. Cognates between related languages often exhibit minor spelling variations, which can be simply due to different rules of orthography, (e.g., senhor vs. se?nor in Portuguese and Spanish), but often stem from real phonological differences. For example, the Portuguese suffix -c??ao corresponds to the Spanish suffix -ci?on, e.g., evoluc??ao vs. evoluci?on. Such correspondences can be quite frequent and thus easy to learn automatically 4 .Even 3 E.g., Latin tu, Old English thou, Spanish t?u, Greek s?u and German du are all cognates meaning ?2 nd person singular?. 4 Not all such differences are systematic; many apply to a particular word only, e.g., kerana vs. karena in Malay and Indonesian, or dizer vs. decir in Portuguese and Spanish. more frequent can be the inflectional variations. For example, in Portuguese and Spanish respectively, verb endings like -ou vs. -?o (for 3rd person singular, simple past tense), e.g., visitou vs. visit?o, or -ei vs. -?e (for 1st person singular, simple past tense), e.g., visitei vs. visit?e. If such systematic differences exist between the languages X 1 and X 2 , it might be useful to learn and to use them as a pre-processing step in order to transliterate the X 2 side of the X 2 -Y bi-text and thus increase its vocabulary overlap with the source language X 1 . We will describe our approach to automatic transliteration in more detail in Section 3.4 below. 3 Experiments 3.1 Language Pairs We experimented with two language pairs: the closely relatedMalay and Indonesian and the more dissimilar Spanish and Portuguese. Malay and Indonesian are mutually intelligible, but differ in pronunciation and vocabulary. An example follows 5 : ? Malay: Semua manusia dilahirkan bebas dan samarata dari segi kemuliaan dan hakhak. ? Indonesian: Semua orang dilahirkan merdeka dan mempunyai martabat dan hak-hak yang sama. Spanish and Portuguese also exhibit a noticeable degree of mutual intelligibility, but differ in pronunciation, spelling, and vocabulary. Unlike Malay and Indonesian, however, they also differ syntactically and have a high degree of spelling differences as demonstrated by the following examples 6 : ? Spanish: Se?nora Presidenta, estimados colegas, lo que est?a sucediendo en Oriente Medio es una tragedia. ? Portuguese: Senhora Presidente, caros colegas, o que est?a a acontecer no Medio Oriente ?e uma trag?edia. 5 In English: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. (from Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) 6 In English: Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the events in the Middle East are a real tragedy. 1360 3.2 Datasets In our experiments, we used the following number of training sentence pairs (number of words shown in parentheses) for English (en), Indonesian (in), Malay (ml), Portuguese(pt), and Spanish (es): ? Indonesian-English (in-en): ? 28,383 pairs (0.8M, 0.9M words); ? monolingual English en in : 5.1M words. ? Malay-English (ml-en): ? 190,503 pairs (5.4M, 5.8M words); ? monoling. English en ml : 27.9M words. ? Spanish-English (es-en): ? 1,240,518 pairs (35.7M, 34.6M words); ? monolingual English en es:pt : 45.3M words (the same as for pt-en). ? Portuguese-English (pt-en): ? 1,230,038 pairs (35.9M, 34.6M words). ? monolingual English en es:pt : 45.3M words (the same as for es-en). All of the above datasets contain sentences with up to 100 tokens. In addition, for each of the four language pairs, we have a development and a testing bi-text, each with 2,000 parallel sentence pairs. We made sure the development and the testing bi-texts shared no sentences withthe training bi-texts; we further excluded from the monolingual English data all sentences from the English sides of the training and the development bi-texts. The training bi-text datasets for es-en and pt-en were built from release v.3 of the Europarl corpus, excluding the Q4/2000 portion out of which we created our testing and development datasets. We built the in-en bi-texts from texts that we downloaded from the Web. We translated the Indonesian texts to English using Google Translate, and we matched 7 them against the English texts using a cosine similarity measure and heuristic constraints based on document length in words and in sentences, overlap of numbers, words in uppercase, and words in the title. Next, we extracted pairs of sentences from the matched document pairs using competitive linking (Melamed, 2000), and we retained the ones whose similarity was above a pre-specified threshold. The ml-en was built in a similar manner. 7 Note that the automatic translations were used for matching only; the final bi-text contained no automatic translations. 3.3 Baseline SMT System In the baseline, we used the following setup: We first tokenized and lowercased both sides of the training bi-text. We then built separate directed word alignments for English?X andX?English (X?{Indonesian, Spanish}) using IBM model 4 (Brown et al, 1993), combined them using the intersect+grow heuristic (Och and Ney, 2003), and extracted phrase-level translation pairs of maximum length seven using the alignment template approach (Och and Ney, 2004). We thus obtained a phrase table where each pair is associated with five parameters: forward and reverse phrase translation probabilities, forward and reverse lexical translation probabilities, and phrase penalty. We then trained a log-linear model using standard SMT feature functions: trigram language model probability, word penalty, distance-based 8 distortion cost, and the parameters from the phrase table. We set al weights by optimizing Bleu (Papineni et al, 2002) using minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) on a separate development set of 2,000 sentences (Indonesian or Spanish), and we used them in a beam search decoder (Koehn et al, 2007) to translate 2,000 test sentences (Indonesian or Spanish) into English. Finally, we detokenized the output, and we evaluated it against a lowercased gold standard using Bleu 9 . 3.4 Transliteration As was mentioned in Section 2, transliteration can be helpful for languages with regular spelling differences. Thus, we built a system for transliteration from Portuguese into Spanish that was trained on a list of automatically extracted likely cognates. The system was applied on the Portuguese side of the pt-en training bi-text. Classic approaches to automatic cognate extraction look for non-stopwords with similar spelling that appear in parallel sentences in a bi-text (Kondrak et al, 2003). In our case, however, we need to extract cognates between Spanish and Portuguese given pt-en and es-en bi-texts only, i.e., without having a pt-es bi-text. Although it is easy to construct a pt-es bi-text from the Europarl corpus, we chose not to do so since, in general, synthe8 We also tried lexicalized reordering (Koehn et al, 2005). While it yielded higher absolute Bleu scores, the relative improvementfor a sample of our experiments was very similar to that achieved with distance-based re-ordering. 9 We used version 11b of the NIST scoring tool: http://www.nist.gov/speech/tools/ 1361 sizing a bi-text for X 1 -X 2 would be impossible: e.g., it cannot be done for ml-in given our training datasets for in-en andml-en since the English sides of these bi-texts have no sentences in common. Thus, we extracted the list of likely cognates between Portuguese and Spanish from the training pt-en and es-en bi-texts using English as a pivot as follows: We started with IBM model 4 word alignments, from which we extracted four conditional lexical translation probabilities: Pr(p j |e i ) and Pr(e i |p j ) for Portuguese-English, and Pr(s k |e i ) and Pr(e i |s k ) for Spanish-English, where p j , e i and s k stand for a Portuguese, an English and a Spanish word respectively. Following Wu and Wang (2007), we then induced conditional lexical translation probabilities Pr(p j |s k ) and Pr(s k |p j ) for Portuguese-Spanish as follows: Pr(p j |s k ) = ? i Pr(p j |e i , s k )Pr(e i |s k ) Assuming p j is conditionally independent of s k given e i , we can simplify the above expression: Pr(p j |s k ) = ? i Pr(p j |e i )Pr(e i |s k ) Similarly, for Pr(s k |p j ), we obtain Pr(s k |p j ) = ? i Pr(s k |e i )Pr(e i |p j ) We excluded all stopwords, words of length less than three, and those containing digits. We further calculated Prod(p j , s k ) = Pr(p j |s k )Pr(s k |p j ), and we excluded all Portuguese-Spanish word pairs (p j , s k ) for which Prod(p j , s k ) < 0.01. From the remaining pairs, we extracted likely cognates based on Prod(p j , s k ) and on the orthographic similarity between p j and s k . Following Melamed (1995), we measured the orthographic similarity using the longest common subsequence ratio (LCSR), defined as follows: LCSR(s 1 , s 2 ) = |LCS(s 1 ,s 2 )| max(|s 1 |,|s 2 |) where LCS(s 1 , s 2 ) is the longest common subsequence of s 1 and s 2 , and |s| is the length of s. We retained as likely cognates all pairs for which LCSR was 0.58 or higher; that value was found by Kondrak et al (2003) to be optimal for a number of language pairs in the Europarl corpus. Finally, we performed competitive linking (Melamed, 2000), assuming that each Portuguese wordform had at most one Spanish best cognate match. Thus, using the values of Prod(p j , s k ), we induced a fully-connected weighted bipartite graph. Then, we performed a greedy approximation to the maximum weighted bipartite matching in that graph (i.e., competitive linking) as follows: First, we accepted as cognates the crosslingual pair (p j, s k ) with the highest Prod(p j , s k ) in the graph, and we discarded p j and s k from further consideration. Then, we accepted the next highest-scored pair, and we discarded the involved wordforms and so forth. The process was repeated until there were no matchable pairs left. As a result of the above procedure, we ended up with 28,725 Portuguese-Spanish cognate pairs, 9,201 (or 32%) of which had spelling differences. For each pair in the list of cognate pairs, we added spaces between any two adjacent letters for both wordforms, and we further appended the start and the end characters ? and $. For example, the cognate pair evoluc??ao ? evoluci?on became ? e v o l u c? ?a o $ ? ? e v o l u c i ?o n $ We randomly split the resulting list into a training (26,725 pairs) and a development dataset (2,000 pairs), and trained and tuned a characterlevel phrase-based monotone SMT system similar to (Finch and Sumita, 2008) to transliterate a Portuguese wordform into a Spanish wordform. We used a Spanish language model trained on 14M word tokens (obtained from the above-mentioned 45.3M-token monolingual English corpus after excluding punctuation, stopwords, words of length less than three, and those containing digits): one per line and character-separated with added start and end characters as in the above example. We set both the maximum phrase length and the language model order to ten; this value was found by tuning on the development dataset. The system was tuned using MERT, and the feature weights were saved. The tuning Bleu was 95.22%, while the baseline Bleu, for leaving the Portuguese words intact, was 87.63%. Finally, the training and the tuning datasets were merged, and a new training round was performed. The resulting system was used with the saved feature weights to transliterate the Portuguese side of the training pt-en bi-text, which yielded a new pt es -en training bi-text. We did the same for Malay into Indonesian. We extracted 5,847 cognate pairs, 844 (or 14.4%) of which had spelling differences, and we trained a transliteration system. The highest tuning Bleu was 95.18% (for maximum phrase size and LM order of 10), but the baseline was 93.15%. We then re-trained the system on the combination of the training and the development datasets, and we transliterated the Malay side of the training ml-en bi-text, obtaining a new ml in -en training bi-text. 1362 # Train LM Dev Test 10K 20K 40K 80K 160K 320K 640K 1230K 1 ml-en en ml ml-en ml-en 44.93 46.98 47.15 48.04 49.01 ? ? ? 2 ml in -en en ml ml-en ml-en 38.99 40.96 41.02 41.88 42.81 ? ? ? 3 ml-en en ml ml-en in-en 13.69 14.58 14.76 15.12 15.84 ? ? ? 4 ml-en en ml in-en in-en 13.98 14.75 14.91 15.51 16.27 ? ? ? 5 ml-en en in in-en in-en 15.56 16.38 16.52 17.04 17.90 ? ? ? 6 ml in -en en in in-en in-en 16.44 17.36 17.62 18.14 19.15 ? ?? 7 pt-en en es:pt pt-en pt-en 21.28 23.11 24.43 25.72 26.43 27.10 27.78 27.96 8 pt es -en en es:pt pt-en pt-en 10.91 11.56 12.16 12.50 12.83 13.27 13.48 13.71 9 pt-en en es:pt pt-en es-en 4.40 4.77 4.57 5.02 4.99 5.32 5.08 5.34 10 pt-en en es:pt es-en es-en 4.91 5.12 5.64 5.82 6.35 6.87 6.44 7.10 11 pt es -en en es:pt es-en es-en 8.18 9.03 9.97 10.66 11.35 12.26 12.69 13.79 Table 1: Cross-lingual SMT experiments (shown in bold). Columns 2-5 present the bi-texts used for training, development and testing, and the monolingual data used to train the English language model. The following columns show the resulting Bleu (in %s) for different numbers of training sentence pairs. 3.5 Cross-lingual Translation In this subsection, we study the similarity between the original and the additional source languages. First, we measured the vocabulary overlap between Spanish and Portuguese, which was feasible since our training pt-en and es-en bi-texts are from the same time span in the Europarl corpus and their English sides largely overlap. We found 110,053 Portuguese and 121,444 Spanish word types, and 44,461 (or 36.6%) of them were identical. Unfortunately, we could not do the same for Malay and Indonesian since the English sides of the in-en and ml-en bi-texts do not overlap. Second, following the setup of the baseline system, we performed cross-lingual experiments. The results are shown in Table 1. As we can see, this yielded a huge decrease in Bleu compared to the baseline ? three to five times ? even for very large training datasets, and even when a proper English LM and development dataset were used: compare line 1 to lines 3-6, and line 7 to lines 9-11. Third, we tried transliteration. Bleu doubled for Spanish (see lines 10-11), but improved far less for Indonesian (lines 5-6). Training on the transliterated data and testing on Malay and Portuguese yielded about 10-12% relative decrease for Malay (lines 1-2) but 50% for Portuguese (lines 78). 10 Thus, unlike Spanish and Portuguese, there were far less systematic spelling variations between Malay and Indonesian. A closer inspection confirmed this: many extracted likely MalayIndonesian cognate pairs with spelling differences were in fact forms of a word existing in both languages, e.g., kata and berkata (?to say?). 10 However, as lines 8 and 11 show, a system trained on 1.23M pt es -en sentence pairs, performs equally well when translating Portuguese and Spanish text: 13.71% vs. 13.79%. 3.6 Using an Additional Language We performed various experiments combining the original and an additional training bi-text: Two-tables: We built two separate phrase tables for the two bi-texts, and we used them in the alternative decoding path model of Birch et al (2007). Interpolation: We built two separate phrase tables for the original and for the additional bitext, and we used linear interpolation to combine the corresponding conditional probabilities: Pr(e|s) = ?Pr orig (e|s) + (1 ? ?)Pr extra (e|s). We optimized the value of ? on the development dataset, trying .5, .6, .7, .8 and .9; we used the same ? forall four conditional probabilities. Merge: We built separate phrase tables, T orig and T extra , for the original and for the additional training bi-text. We then concatenated them giving priority to T orig : We kept all phrase pairs from T orig , adding to them those ones from T extra that were not present in T orig . For each phrase pair added, we retained its associated conditional probabilities and the phrase penalty. We further added three additional features to each entry in the new table: F 1 , F 2 and F 3 . The value of F 1 was 1 if the phrase pair came from T orig , and 0.5 otherwise. Similarly, F 2 =1 if the phrase pair came from T extra , and F 2 =0.5 otherwise. The value of F 3 was 1 if the pair came from both T orig and T extra , and 0.5 otherwise. We experimented using (1) F 1 only, (2) F 1 and F 2 , (3) F 1 , F 2 , and F 3 . We set all feature weights using MERT, and we optimized the number of features on the development set. 11 11 In theory, we should have also re-normalized the probabilities since they may not sum to one. In practice, this was not that important since the log-linear SMT model does not require that the features be probabilities at all (e.g., the phrase penalty), and we had extra features whose impact was bigger. 1363 Concat?k: We concatenated k copies of the original and one copy of the additional training bitext; we then trained and tuned an SMT system as for the baseline. The value for k was optimized on the development dataset. Concat?k:align: We concatenated k copies of the original and one copy of the additional training bi-text. We then generated IBM model 4 word alignments, and we truncated them, only keeping them for one copy of the original training bi-text. Next, we extracted phrase pairs, thus buildng a phrase table, and we tuned an SMT system as for the baseline. Our Method: Our method was described in Section 2. We used merge to combine the phrase tables for concat?k:align and concat?1, considering the former as T orig and the latter as T extra . We had two parameters to tune: k and the number of extra features in the merged phrase table. Figure 1: Impact of k on Bleu for concat?k for different number of extra ml-en sentence pairs in Indonesian?English SMT. 4 Results and Discussion First, we studied the impact of k on concat?k for Indonesian?English SMT using Malay as an additional language. We tried all values of k such that 1?k?16 with 10000n extra ml-en sentence pairs, n?{1,2,4,8,16}. As we can see in Figure 1, the highest Bleu scores are achieved for (n; k)?{(1;2),(2;2),(4;4),(8;7),(16;16)}, i.e., when k ? n. In order to limit the search space, we used this relationship between k and n in our experiments (also for Portuguese and Spanish). Table 2 shows the results for experiments onimproving Indonesian?English SMT using 10K, 20K, . . ., 160K additional ml-en pairs of parallel sentences. Several observations can be made. First, using more additional sentences yields better results. Second, with one exception, all experiments yield improvements over the baseline. Third, the improvements are always statistically significant for our method, according to (Collins et al, 2005)?s sign test. Overall, among the different bi-text combination strategies, our method performs best, followed by concat?k, merge, and interpolate, which are very close in performance; these three strategies are the only ones to consistently yield higher Bleu as the number of additional ml-en sentence pairs grows. Methods like concat?1, concat?k:align and two-tables are somewhat inconsistent in that respect. The latter method performs worst and is the only one to go below the baseline (for 10K ml-en pairs). Table 3 shows the results when using pt-en data to improve Spanish?English SMT. Overall, the results and the conclusions that can be made are consistent with those for Table 2. We can further observe that, as the size of the original bi-text increases, the gain in Bleu decreases, which is to be expected. Note also that here transliteration is very important: it doubles the absolute gain in Bleu. Finally, Table 4 shows a comparison to the pivoting technique of Callison-Burch et al (2006). for English?Spanish SMT. Despite using just Portuguese, we achieve an improvement that is, in five out of six cases, much better than what they achieve with eight pivot languages (which include not only Portuguese, but also two other Romance languages, French and Italian, which are closely related to Spanish). Moreover, our method yields improvements for very large original datasets ? 1.2M pairs, while theirs stops improving at 160K. However, our improvements are only statistically significant for 160K original pairs or less. Finally, note that our translation direction is reversed. Based on the experimental results, we can make several conclusions. First, we have shown that using bi-text data from related languages improves SMT: we achieved up to 1.35 and 3.37 improvement in Bleu for in-en (+ml-en) and es-en (+pten) respectively. Second, while simple concatenation can help, it is problematic when the additional sentences out-number the ones from the original bi-text. Third, concatenation can work very well if the original bi-text is repeated enough times so that the additional bi-text does not dominate. Fourth, merging phrase tables giving priority to the original bi-text and using additional fea1364 in-en ml-en Baseline Two tables Interpol.

Fifth, part of the improvement when combining bi-texts is due to increased vocabulary coverage because of cognates, but another part comes from improved word alignments. Sixth, the best results are achieved when the latter two sources are first isolated and then combined (our method). Finally, transliteration can help a lot in case of systematic spelling variations between the original and the additional source languages. 5 RelatedWork In this section, we describe two general lines of related previous research: using cognates between the source and the target language, and sourcelanguage side paraphrasing with a pivot language. 5.1 Cognates Many researchers have used likely cognates to obtain improved word alignments and thus build better SMT systems. Al-Onaizan et al (1999) extracted such likely cognates for Czech-English using one of the variations of LCSR (Melamed, 1995) described in (Tiedemann, 1999) as a similarity measure. They used these cognates to improve word alignments with IBM models 1-4 in three different ways: (1) by seeding the parameters of IBM model 1, (2) by constraining the word cooccurrences when training IBM models 1-4, and (3) by adding the cognate pairs to the bi-text as additional ?sentence pairs?. The last approach performed best and was later used by Kondrak et al (2003) who demonstrated improved SMT for nine European languages. Unlike these approaches, which extract cognates between the source and the target language, we use cognates between the source and some other related language that is different from the target. Moreover, we only implicitly rely on the existence of such cognates; we do not try to extract them at all, and we leave them in their original sentence contexts. 12 12 However, in some of our experiments, we extract cognates for training a transliteration system from the resourcerich source language X 2 into the resource-poor one X 1 . 1365 Direction System 10K 20K 40K 80K 160K 320K 1,230K en?es baseline 22.6 25.0 26.5 26.5 28.7 30.0 ? pivoting (+8 languages ? ?1.3M pairs) 23.3 26.0 27.2 28.0 29.0 30.0 ? improvement +0.7 +1.0 +0.7 +1.5 +0.3 +0.0 ? es?en baseline 22.87 24.71 25.80 27.08 27.90 28.46 29.90 our method (+1 language ? 160K pairs) 23.98 ? 25.65 ? 26.49 ? 27.30 \\x05 28.05 28.52 29.87 improvement +1.11 ? +0.94 ? +0.69 ? +0.22 \\x05 +0.15 +0.06 -0.03 our method (translit., +1 lang. ? 160K) 25.73 ? 26.36 ? 26.95 ? 27.49 ? 28.16 28.43 29.94 improvement +2.86 ? +1.65 ? +1.15 ? +0.41 ? +0.26 -0.03 +0.04 our method (+1 language ? 1.23M pairs) 24.23 ? 25.70 ? 26.78 ? 27.49 28.22 \\x05 28.58 29.84 improvement +1.36 ? +0.99 ? +0.98 ? +0.41 +0.32 \\x05 +0.12 -0.06 our method (translit., +1 lang. ? 1.23M) 26.24 ? 26.82 ? 27.47 ? 27.85 ? 28.50 ? 28.70 29.99 improvement +3.37 ? +2.11 ? +1.67 ? +0.77 ? +0.60 ? +0.24 +0.09 Table 4: Comparison to the pivoting technique of Callison-Burch et al (2006) for English?Spanish. Shown are Bleu scores (in %s) and absolute improvement over the baseline for training bi-texts with different numbers of parallel sentences (10K, 20K, . . ., 1230K) and fixed amount of additional data: (1) about 1.3M sentence pairs for each of eight additional languages in Callison-Burch et al (2006)?s pivoting, and (2) 160K and 1,230K pairs for one language (Portuguese) for our method. Statistically significant improvements over the baseline are marked with a ? (for p < 0.01) and with a \\x05 (for p < 0.05). 5.2 Paraphrasing with aPivot-Language Another relevant line of research is on using multilingual parallel corpora to improve SMT using additional languages as pivots. Callison-Burch et al (2006) improved English?Spanish and English?French SMT using source-language paraphrases extracted with the pivoting technique of Bannard and CallisonBurch (2005) and eight additional languages from the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005). For example, using German as a pivot, they extracted English paraphrases from a parallel English-German corpus by looking for English phrases that were aligned to the same German phrase: e.g., if under control and in check were aligned to unter controlle, they were hypothesized to be paraphrases with some probability. Such (English) paraphrases were added as additional entries in the phrase table of an English?Spanish/English?French phrase-based SMT system and paired with the foreign (Spanish/French) translation of the original (English) phrase. The system was then tuned with MERT using an extra feature penalizing low-probability paraphrases; this yielded up to 1.8% absolute improvement in Bleu. Other important publications about pivoting approaches for machine translation include (Wu and Wang, 2007), (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007), (Haji?c et al, 2000) and (Habash and Hu, 2009). Unlike pivoting, which can only improve source-language lexical coverage, we augment both the source- and the target-language sides. Second, while pivoting ignores context when extracting paraphrases, we take it into account. Third, by using as an additional language one that is related to the source, we are able to get increase in Bleu that is comparable and even better than what pivoting achieves with eight pivot languages. On the negative side, our approach is limited in that it requires that X 2 be related to X 1 , while the pivoting language Z does not need to be related to X 1 nor to Y . However, we only need one additional parallel corpus (for X 2 -Y ), while pivoting needs two: one for X 1 -Z and one for Z-Y . Finally, note that our approach is orthogonal to pivoting, and thus the two can be combined. 6 Conclusion and Future Work We have proposed a novel method for improving SMT for resource-poor languages by exploiting their similarity to resource-rich ones. In future work, we would like to extend that approach in several interesting directions. First, we want to make better use of multi-lingual parallel corpora, e.g., while we had access to a SpanishPortuguese-English corpus, we used it as two separate bi-texts Spanish-English and PortugueseEnglish. Second, we would like to exploit multiple auxiliary resource-rich languages the resourcepoor source language is related to. Third, we could also experiment with using auxiliary languages that are related to the target language. Acknowledgments This research was supported by research grant POD0713875. 1366'  \\\n",

       "  b'Introduction  Although the field of machine translation has a  very long history, the number of really successful  systems is not very impressive. Most of the funds  invested into the development of various MT  systems have been wasted and have not  stimulated a development of techniques which  would allow to translate at least technical texts  from a certain limited domain. There were, of  course, exceptions, which demonstrated that  under certain conditions it is possible to develop  a system which will save money and efforts  invested into human translation. The main reason  why the field of MT has not met the expectations  of sci-fi literature, but also the expectations of  scientific community, is the complexity of the  task itself. A successful automatic translation  system requires an application of techniques from  several areas of computational inguistics  (morphology, syntax, semantics, discourse  analysis etc.) as a necessary, but not a sufficient  condition. The general opinion is that it is easier  to create an MT system for a pair of related  languages. In our contribution we would like to  demonstrate hat this assumption holds only for  really very closely related languages.  1. Czech-to-Russian MT system RUSLAN  1.1 History  The first attempt o verify the hypothesis that  related languages are easier to translate started in  mid 80s at Charles University in Prague. The  project was called RUSLAN and aimed at the  translation of documentation i the domain of  operating systems for mainframe computers. It  was developed in cooperation with the Research  Institute of Mathematical Machines in Prague. At  that time in former COMECON countries it was  obligatory to translate any kind of documentation  to such systems into Russian. The work on the  Czech-to-Russian MT system RUSLAN (cf. Oliva  (1989)) started in 1985. It was terminated in 1990  (with COMECON gone) for the lack of funding.  1.2 System description  The system was rule-based, implemented in  Colmerauer\\'s Q-systems. It contained a full-  fledged morphological and syntactic analysis of  Czech, a transfer and a syntactic and  morphological generation of Russian. There was  almost no transfer at the beginning of the project  due to the assumption that both languages are  similar to the extent that does not require any  transfer phase at all. This assumption turned to be  wrong and several phenomena were covered by  the transfer in the later stage of the project (for  example the translation of the Czech verb \"b~\"  \\\\[to be\\\\] into one of the three possible Russian  equivalents: empty form, the form \"byt6\" in future  7  tense and the verb \"javljat6sja\"; or the translation  of verbal negation).  At the time when the work was terminated in  1990, the system had a main translation  dictionary of about 8000 words, accompanied by  so called transducing dictionary coveringanother  2000 words. The transducing dictionary was  based on the original idea described in Kirschner  (1987). It aimed at the exploitation of the fact  that technical terms are based (in a majority of  European languages) on Greek or Latin stems,  adopted according to the particular derivational  rules of the given languages. This fact allows for  the \"translation\" of technical terms by means of a  direct transcription of productive ndings and a  slight (regular) adjustment of the spelling of the  stem. For example, the English words  localization and discrimination can be  transcribed into Czech as \"lokalizace\" and  \"diskriminace\" with a productive nding -ation  being transcribed to -ace. It was generally  assumed that for the pair Czech/Russian the  transducing dictionary would be able to profit  from a substantially greater number of productive  rules. This hypothesis proved to be wrong, too  (see B6mov~, Kubofi (1990)). The set of  productive ndings for both pairs (English/Czech,  as developed for an earlier MT system from  English to Czech, and Czech/Russian) was very  similar.  The evaluation of results of RUSLAN showed  that roughly 40% of input sentences were  translated correctly, about 40% with minor errors  correctable by a human post-editor and about  20% of the input required substantial editing or  re-translation. There were two main factors that  caused a deterioration of the translation. The first  factor was the incompleteness of the main  dictionary of the system. Even though the system  contained a set of so-called fail-soft rules, whose  task was to handle such situations, an unknown  word typically caused a failure of the module of   syntactic analysis, because the dictionary entries  contained - besides the translation equivalents  and morphological information - very important  syntactic information.  The second factor was the module of syntactic  analysis of Czech. There were several reasons of  parsing failures. Apart from the common inability  of most rule-based formal grammars to cover a  particular natural anguage to the finest detail of  its syntax there were other problems. One of  them  was the existence of non-projective constructions,  which are quite common in Czech even in  relatively short sentences. Even though they  account only for 1.7?/\\'o f syntactic dependencies,  every third Czech sentence contains at least one,  and in a news corpus, we discovered as much as  15 non-projective dependencies; see also Haji6 et  al. (1998). An example of a non-projective  construction is \"Soubor se nepodafilo otev~it.\"  \\\\[lit.: File Refl. was_not._possible to_open. - It was  not possible to open the file\\\\]. The formalism used  for the implementation (Q-systems) was not meant  to handle non-projective constructions. Another  source of trouble was the use of so-called  semantic features. These features were based on  lexical semantics of individual words. Their main  task was to support asemantically plausible  analysis and to block the implausible ones. It  turned out that the question of implausible  combinations of  semantic features is also more  complex than it was supposed to be. The practical  outcome of the use of semantic features was a  higher atio of parsing failures - semantic features  often blocked a plausible analysis. For example,  human lexicographers a signed the verb \\'to run\\' a  semantic feature stating that only a noun with  semantic features of a human or other living being  may be assigned the role of subject of this verb.  The input text was however full of sentences with  \\'programs\\' or \\'systems\\' running etc. It was of  course very easy to correct he semantic feature in  the dictionary, but the problem was that there  were far too many corrections required.  On the other hand, the fact that both languages  allow a high degree of word-order freedom  accounted for a certain simplification of  the  translation process. The grammar elied on the  fact that there are only minor word-order  differences between Czech and Russian.  1.3 Lessons learned  f rom RUSLAN  We have learned several lessons regarding the MT  of closely related languages:  ? The transfer-based approach provides a  similar quality of translation both for closely  related and typologically different languages  ? Two main bottlenecks of full-fledged  transfer-based systems are:  8  - complexity of the syntactic dictionary  - relative unreliability of the syntactic  analysis of the source language  Even a relatively simple component  (transducing dictionary) was equally complex  for English-to-Czech and Czech-to-Russian  translation  Limited text domains do not exist in real life,  it is necessary to work with a high coverage  dictionary at least for the source language.  2. Translation and localization  2.1 A pivot language  Localization of products and their documentation  is a great problem for any company, which wants  to strengthen its position on foreign language  market, especially for companies producing  various kinds of  software. The amounts of texts  being localized are huge and the localization  costs are huge as well.  It is quite clear that the localization from one  source language to several target languages,  which are typologically similar, but different  from the source language, is a waste of money  and effort. It is of course much easier to translate  texts from Czech to Polish or from Russian to  Bulgarian than from English or German to any of  these languages. There are several reasons, why  localization and translation is not being  performed through some pivot language,  representing a certain group of closely related  languages. Apart from political reasons the  translation through a pivot language has several  drawbacks. The most important one is the  problem of the loss of translation quality.Each  translation may to a certain extent shift the  meaning of the translated text and thus each  subsequent translation provides results more and  more different from the original. The second  most important reason is the lack of translators  from the pivot to the target language, while this is  usually no problem for the translation from the  source directly to the target language.  2.2 Translation memory is the key  The main goal of this paper is to suggest how to  overcome these obstacles by means of a  combination of an MT system with commercial  MAHT (Machine-aided human translation)  systems. We have chosen the TRADOS  Translator\\'s Workbench as a representative  system of a class of these products, which can be  characterized as an example-based translation  tools. IBM\\'s Translation Manager and other  products also belong to this class. Such systems  uses so-called translation memory, which contains  pairs of previously translated sentences from a  source to a target language. When a human  translator starts translating a new sentence, the  system tries to match the source with sentences  already stored in the translation memory. If it is  successful, it suggests the translation and the  human translator decides whether to use it, to  modify it or to reject it.  The segmentation f a translation memory is a key  feature for our system. The translation memory  may be exported into a text file and thus allows  easy manipulation with its content. Let us suppose  that we have at our disposal two translation  memories - one human made for the source/pivot  language pair and the other created by an MT  system for the pivot/target language pair. The  substitution of segments of a pivot language by  the segments of a target language is then only a  routine procedure. The human translator  translating from the source language to the target  language then gets a translation memory for the  required pair (source/target). The system of  penalties applied in TRADOS Translator\\'s  Workbench (or a similar system) guarantees that if  there is already a human-made translation present,  then it gets higher priority than the translation  obtained as a result of the automatic MT. This  system solves both problems mentioned above -  the human translators from the pivot to the target  language are not needed at all and the machine-  made translation memory serves only as a  resource supporting the direct human translation  from the source to the target language.  3. Mach ine  t rans lat ion of  (very) closely  related Slavic languages  In the group of Slavic languages, there are more  closely related languages than Czech and Russian.  Apart from the pair of Serbian and Croatian  languages, which are almost identical and were  9  considered one language just a few years ago,the  most closely related languages in this group are  Czech and Slovak.  This fact has led us to an experiment with  automatic translation between Czech and Slovak.  It was clear that application of a similar method  to that one used in the system RUSLAN would  lead to similar results. Due to the closeness of  both languages we have decided to apply a  simpler method. Our new system, (~ESILKO,  aims at a maximal exploitation of the similarity  of both languages. The system uses the method of  direct word-for-word translation, justified by the  similarity of syntactic constructions of both  languages.  Although the system is currently being tested on  texts from the domain of documentation to  corporate information systems, it is not limited to  any specific domain. Its primary task is, however,  to provide support for translation and localization  of various technical texts.  3.1 System (~ESiLKO  The greatest problem of the word-for-word  translation approach (for languages with very  similar syntax and word order, but different  morphological system) is the problem of  morphological ambiguity of individual word  forms. The type of ambiguity is slightly different  in languages with a rich inflection (majority of  Slavic languages) and in languages which do not  have such a wide variety of forms derived from a  single lemma. For example, in Czech there are  only rare cases of part-of-speech ambiguities ( t~t  \\\\[to stay/the state\\\\], zena \\\\[woman/chasing\\\\] or tri  \\\\[three/rub(imperative)\\\\]), much more frequent is  the ambiguity of gender, number and case (for  example, the form of the adjective jam\\\\[ \\\\[spring\\\\]  is 27-times ambiguous). The main problem is that  even though several Slavic languages have the  same property as Czech, the ambiguity is not  preserved. It is distributed in a different manner  and the \"form-for-form\" translation is not  applicable.  Without he analysis of at least nominal groups it  is often very difficult to solve this problem,  because for example the actual morphemic  categories of adjectives are in Czech  distinguishable only on the basis of gender,  number and case agreement between an adjective  and its governing noun. An alternative way to the  solution of this problem was the application of a  stochastically based morphological disambiguator  (morphological tagger) for Czech whose success  rate is close to 92?/\\'0. Our system therefore consists  of the following modules:  1. Import of the input from so-called \\'empty\\'  translation memory  2. Morphological analysis of Czech  3. Morphological disambiguation  4. Domain-related bilingual glossaries (incl.  single- and multiword terminology)  5. General bilingual dictionary  6. Morphological synthesis of Slovak  7. Export of the output o the original translation  memory  Letus now look in a more detail at the individual  modules of the system:  ad 1. The input text is extracted out of a  translationmemory previously exported into an  ASCII file. The exported translation memory (of  TRADOS) has a SGML-Iike notation with a  relatively simple structure (cf. the following  example):  Example 1. - A sample of the exported translation  memory  <RTF Preamble>...</RTF Preamble>  <TrU>  <CrD>23051999  <CrU>VK  <Seg L=CS_01>Pomoci v~kazu ad-hoc m65ete  rychle a jednoduge vytv~i~et regerge.  <Seg L=SK_01 >n/a  </TrU>  Our system uses only the segments marked by  <Seg L=CS_01>, which contain one source  language sentence ach, and <Seg L=SK_01>,  which is empty and which will later contain the  same sentence translated into the target language  by CESiLKO.  ad 2. The morphological analysis of Czech is  based on the morphological dictionary developed  by Jan Haji6 and Hana Skoumalov~i in 1988-99  (for latest description, see Haji~ (1998)). The  dictionary contains over 700 000 dictionary  entries and its typical coverage varies between  10  99% (novels) to 95% (technical texts). The  morphological analysis uses the system of  positional tags with 15 positions (each  morphological .category, such as Part-of-speech,  Number, Gender, Case, etc. has a fixed, single-  symbol place in the tag).  Example 2 - tags assigned to the word-form  \"pomoci\" (help/by means of)  pomoci:  NFP2 .... . .  A .... \\\\]NFS7 ...... A .... I R--2 . . . . . . . . . . .   where :  N - noun; R - preposition  F - feminine gender  S - singular, P - plural  7, 2 - case (7 - instrumental, 2 - genitive)  A - affirmative (non negative)  ad 3. The module of morphological  disambiguation is a key to the success of  the  translation. It gets an average number of 3.58  tags per token (word form in text) as an input.  The tagging system is purely statistical, and it  uses a log-linear model of probability distribution  - see Haji~, Hladkfi (1998). The learning is based  on a manually tagged corpus of Czech texts  (mostly from the general newspaper domain).  The system learns contextual rules (features)  automatically and also automatically determines  feature weights. The average accuracy of tagging  is between 91 and 93% and remains the same  even for technical texts (if we disregard the  unknown names and foreign-language t rms that  are not ambiguous anyway).  The lemmatization immediately follows tagging;  it chooses the first lemma with a possible tag  corresponding to the tag selected. Despite this  simple lemmatization method, and also thanks to  the fact that Czech words are rarely ambiguous in  their Part-of-speech, it works with an accuracy  exceeding 98%.  ad 4. The domain-related bilingual glossaries  contain pairs of individual words and pairs of  multiple-word terms. The glossaries are  organized into a hierarchy specified by the user;  typically, the glossaries for themost specific  domain are applied first. There is one general  matching rule for all levels of glossaries - the  longest match wins.  The multiple-word terms are sequences of lemmas  (not word forms). This structure has several  advantages, among others it allows to minimize  the size of the dictionary and also, due to the  simplicity of the structure, it allows modifications  of the glossaries by the linguistically naive user.  The necessary morphological information is  introduced into the domain-related glossary in an  off-line preprocessing stage, which does not  require user intervention. This makes a big  difference when compared to the RUSLAN  Czech-to-Russian MT system, when each  multiword dictionary entry cost about 30 minutes  of linguistic expert\\'s time on average.  ad 5. The main bilingual dictionary contains data  necessary for the translation of  both lemmas and  tags. The translation of tags (from the Czech into  the Slovak morphological system) is necessary,  because due to the morphological differences both  systems use close, but slightly different tagsets.  Currently the system handles the 1:1 translation of  tags (and 2:2, 3:3, etc.). Different ratio of  translation is very rare between Czech and Siovak,  but nevertheless an advanced system of dictionary  items is under construction (for the translation 1:2,  2:1 etc.). It is quite interesting that the lexically  homonymous words often preserve their  homonymy even after the translation, so no  special treatment of homonyms is deemed  necessary.  ad 6. The morphological synthesis of Slovak is  based on a monolingual dictionary of SIovak,  developed by J.Hric (1991-99), covering more  than \\\\]00,000 dictionary entries. The coverage of  the dictionary is not as high as of  the Czech one,  but it is still growing. It aims at a similar coverage  of Slovak as we enjoy for Czech.  ad 7. The export of  the output of the system  (~ESILKO into the translation memory (of  TRADOS Translator\\'s Workbench) amounts  mainly to cleaning of all irrelevant SGML  markers. The whole resulting Slovak sentence is  inserted into the appropriate location in the  original translation memory file. The following  example also shows that the marker <CrU>  contains an information that the target language  sentence was created by an MT system.  11  Example 3. -A  sample of the translation memory  containing the results of MT  <RTF Preamble>...</RTF Preamble>  <TrU>  <CRD>23051999  <CrU>MT!  <Seg L=CS_01>Pomoci v~kazu ad-hoc mfi~ete  rychle a jednodu~e vytv~i~et re,erie.  <Seg L=SK_01>Pomoci v~kazov ad-hoc m6~ete  r~chio a jednoducho vytvhrat\\' re,erie.  </TrU>  3.2 Evaluation of results  The problem how to evaluate results of automatic  translation is very difficult. For the evaluation of  our system we have exploited the close  connection between our system and the  TRADOS Translator\\'s Workbench. The method  is simple - the human translatoreceives the  translation memory created by our system and  translates the text using this memory. The  translator is free to make any changes to the text  proposed by the translation memory. The target  text created by a human translator is then  compared with the text created by the mechanical  application of translation memory to the source  text. TRADOS then evaluates the percentage of  matching in the same manner as it normally  evaluates the percentage of matching of source  text with sentences in translation memory. Our  system achieved about 90% match (as defined by  the TRADOS match module) with the results of  human translation, based on a relatively large  (more than 10,000 words) test sample. 4. Conclusions  The accuracy of the translation achieved by our  system justifies the hypothesis that word-for-  word translation might be a solution for MT of  really closely related languages. The remaining  problems to be solved are problems with the one-  to many or many-to-many translation, where the  lack of information in glossaries and dictionaries  sometimes causes an unnecessary translation  error.  The success of the system CESILKO has  encouraged the investigation of the possibility to  use the same method for other pairs of Slavic  languages, namely for Czech-to-Polish translation.  Although these languages are not so similar as  Czech and Slovak, we hope that an addition of a  simple partial noun phrase parsing might provide  results with the quality comparable to the full-  fledged syntactic analysis based system RUSLAN  (this is of course true also for the Czechoto-Slovak  translation). The first results of Czech-to Polish  translation are quite encouraging in this respect,  even though we could not perform as rigorous  testing as we did for Slovak.

In neural machine translation, one builds a single neural network that reads a source sentence and generates its translation. The whole neural network is jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a correct translation given a source sentence, using the bilingual corpus. The NMT models have shown to perform as well as the most widely used conventional translation systems (Sutskever et al, 2014; Bahdanau et al, 2015). Neural machine translation has a number of advantages over the existing statistical machine translation system, specifically, the phrase-based system (Koehn et al, 2003). First, NMT requires a minimal set of domain knowledge. For instance, all of the models proposed in (Sutskever et al, 2014), (Bahdanau et al, 2015) or (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013) do not assume any linguistic property in both source and target sentences except that they are sequences of words. Second, the whole system is jointly trained to maximize the translation performance, unlike the existing phrase-based system which consists of many separately trained features whose weights are then tuned jointly. Lastly, the memory footprint of the NMT model is often much smaller than the existing system which relies on maintaining large tables of phrase pairs. Despite these advantages and promising results, there is a major limitation in NMT compared to the existing phrase-based approach. That is, the number of target words must be limited. This is mainly because the complexity of training and using an NMT model increases as the number of target words increases. A usual practice is to construct a target vocabulary of the K most frequent words (a socalled shortlist), where K is often in the range of 30k (Bahdanau et al, 2015) to 80k (Sutskever et al., 2014). Any word not included in this vocabulary is mapped to a special token representing an unknown word [UNK]. This approach works well when there are only a few unknown words in the target sentence, but it has been observed 1 that the translation performance degrades rapidly as the number of unknown words increases (Cho et al, 2014a; Bahdanau et al, 2015). In this paper, we propose an approximate training algorithm based on (biased) importance sampling that allows us to train an NMT model with a much larger target vocabulary. The proposed algorithm effectively keeps the computational complexity during training at the level of using only a small subset of the full vocabulary. Once the model with a very large target vocabulary is trained, one can choose to use either all the target words or only a subset of them. We compare the proposed algorithm against the baseline shortlist-based approach in the tasks of English?French and English?German translation using the NMT model introduced in (Bahdanau et al, 2015). The empirical results demonstrate that we can potentially achieve better translation performance using larger vocabularies, and that our approach does not sacrifice too much speed for both training and decoding. Furthermore, we show that the modeltrained with this algorithm gets the best translation performance yet achieved by single NMT models on the WMT?14 English?French translation task. 2 Neural Machine Translation and Limited Vocabulary Problem In this section, we briefly describe an approach to neural machine translation proposed recently in (Bahdanau et al, 2015). Based on this description we explain the issue of limited vocabularies in neural machine translation. 2.1 Neural Machine Translation Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation, which uses a single neural network trained jointly to maximize the translation performance (Forcada and ? Neco, 1997; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014b; Sutskever et al, 2014; Bahdanau et al, 2015). Neural machine translation is often implemented as the encoder?decoder network. The encoder reads the source sentence x = (x 1 , . . . , x T ) and encodes it into a sequence of hidden states h = (h 1 , ? ? ? , h T ): h t = f (x t , h t?1 ) . (1) Then, the decoder, another recurrent neural network, generates a corresponding translation y = (y 1 , ? ? ? , y T ? ) based on the encoded sequence of hidden states h: p(y t | y &lt;t , x) ? exp {q (y t?1 , z t , c t )} , (2) where z t = g (y t?1 , z t?1 , c t ) , (3) c t = r (z t?1 , h 1 , . . . , h T ) , (4) and y &lt;t = (y 1 , . . . , y t?1 ). The whole model is jointly trained to maximize the conditional log-probability of the correct translation given a source sentence with respect to the parameters ? of the model: ? ? = argmax ? N ? n=1 T n ? t=1 log p(y n t | y n &lt;t , x n ), where (x n , y n ) is the n-th training pair of sentences, and T n is the length of the n-th target sentence (y n ). 2.1.1 Detailed Description In this paper, we use a specific implementation of neural machine translation that uses an attention mechanism, as recently proposed in (Bahdanau et al., 2015). In (Bahdanau et al, 2015), the encoder in Eq. (1) is implemented by a bi-directional recurrent neural network such that h t = [ ?? h t ; ?? h t ] , where ?? h t = f ( x t , ?? h t+1 ) , ?? h t = f ( x t , ?? h t?1 ) . They used a gated recurrent unit for f (see, e.g., (Cho et al, 2014b)). The decoder, at each time, computes the context vector c t as a convex sum of the hidden states (h 1 , . . . , h T ) with the coefficients ? 1 , . . . , ? T computed by ? t = exp {a (h t , zt?1 )} ? k exp {a (h k , z t?1 )} , (5) where a is a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer. A new hidden state z t of the decoder in Eq. (3) is computed based on the previous hidden state z t?1 , previous generated symbol y t?1 and the computed 2 context vector c t . The decoder also uses the gated recurrent unit, as the encoder does. The probability of the next target word in Eq. (2) is then computed by p(y t | y &lt;t , x) = 1 Z exp { w &gt; t ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ) + b t } , (6) where ? is an affine transformation followed by a nonlinear activation, and w t and b t are respectively the target word vector and the target word bias. Z is the normalization constant computed by Z = ? k:y k ?V exp { w &gt; k ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ) + b k } , (7) where V is the set of all the target words. For the detailed description of the implementation, we refer the reader to the appendix of (Bahdanau et al, 2015). 2.2 Limited Vocabulary Issue and Conventional Solutions One of the main difficulties in training this neural machine translation model is the computational complexity involved in computing the target word probability (Eq. (6)). More specifically, we need to compute the dot product between the feature ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ) and the word vector w t as many times as there are words in a target vocabulary in order to compute the normalization constant (the denominator in Eq. (6)). This has to be done for, on average, 20?30 words per sentence, which easily becomes prohibitively expensive even with a moderate number of possible target words. Furthermore, the memory requirement grows linearly with respect to the number of target words. This has been a major hurdle for neural machine translation, compared to the existing non-parametric approaches such as phrase-based translation systems. Recently proposed neural machine translation models, hence, use a shortlist of 30k to 80k most frequent words (Bahdanau et al, 2015; Sutskever et al, 2014). This makes training more feasible, but comes with a number of problems. First of all, the performance of the model degrades heavily if the translation of a source sentence requires many words that are not included in the shortlist (Cho et al, 2014a). This also affects the performance evaluation of the system which is often measured by BLEU. Second, the first issue becomes more problematic with languages that have a rich set of words such as German or other highly inflected languages. There are two model-specific approaches to this issue of large target vocabulary. The first approach is to stochastically approximate the target word probability. This has been proposed recently in (Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013; Mikolov et al, 2013) based on noise-contrastive estimation (Gutmann and Hyvarinen, 2010). In the second approach, thetarget words are clustered into multiple classes, or hierarchical classes, and the target probability p(y t |y &lt;t , x) is factorized as a product of the class probability p(c t |y &lt;t , x) and the intraclass word probability p(y t |c t , y &lt;t , x). This reduces the number of required dot-products into the sum of the number of classes and the words in a class. These approaches mainly aim at reducing the computational complexity during training, but do not often result in speed-up when decoding a translation during test time. 1 Other than these model-specific approaches, there exist translation-specific approaches. A translation-specific approach exploits the properties of the rare target words. For instance, Luong et al proposed such an approach for neural machine translation (Luong et al, 2015). They replace rare words (the words that are not included in the shortlist) in both source and target sentences into corresponding ?OOV n ? tokens using the word alignment model. Once a source sentence is translated, each ?OOV n ? in the translation will be replaced based on the source word marked by the corresponding ?OOV n ?. It is important to note that the modelspecific approaches and the translation-specific approaches are often complementary and can be used together to further improve the translation performance and reduce the computational complexity. 3 Approximate Learning Approach to Very Large Target Vocabulary 3.1 Description In this paper, we propose a model-specific approach that allows us to train a neural machine translation model with a very large target vocabulary. With the proposed approach, the compu1 This is due to the fact that the beam search requires the conditional probability of every target word at each time step regardless of the parametrization of the output probability. 3 tational complexity of training becomes constant with respect to the size of the target vocabulary. Furthermore, the proposed approach allows us to efficiently use a fast computing device with limited memory, such as a GPU, to train a neural machine translation model with a much larger target vocabulary. As mentioned earlier, the computational inefficiency of training a neural machine translation model arises from the normalization constant in Eq. (6). In order to avoid the growing complexity of computing the normalization constant, we propose here to use only a small subset V ? of the target vocabulary at each update. The proposed approach is based on the earlier work of (Bengio and S?en?ecal, 2008). Let us consider the gradient of the logprobability of the output in Eq. (6). The gradient is composed of a positive and negative part: ? log p(y t | y &lt;t , x) (8) =?E(y t )? ? k:y k ?V p(y k | y &lt;t , x)?E(y k ), where we define the energy E as E(y j ) = w &gt; j ? (y j?1 , z j , c j ) + b j . The second, or negative, term of the gradient is in essence the expected gradient of the energy: E P [?E(y)] , (9) where P denotes p(y| y &lt;t , x). The main idea of the proposed approach is to approximate this expectation, or the negative term of the gradient, by importance sampling with a small number of samples. Given a predefined proposal distribution Q and a set V ? of samples from Q, we approximate the expectation in Eq. (9) with E P [?E(y)] ? ? k:y k ?V ? ? k ? k ? :y k ? ?V ? ? k ? ?E(y k ), (10) where ? k = exp {E(y k )? logQ(y k )} . (11) This approach allows us to compute the normalization constant during training using only a small subset of the target vocabulary, resulting in much lower computational complexity for each parameter update. Intuitively, at each parameter update, we update only the vectors associated with the correct word w t and with the sampled words in V ? . Once training is over, we can use the full target vocabulary to compute the output probability of each target word. Although the proposed approach naturally addresses the computational complexity, using this approach naively does not guarantee that the number of parameters being updated for each sentence pair, which includes multiple target words, is bounded nor can be controlled. This becomes problematic when training is done, for instance, on a GPU with limited memory. In practice, hence, we partition the training corpus and define a subset V ? of the target vocabulary for each partition prior to training. Before training begins, we sequentially examine each target sentence in the training corpus and accumulate unique target words until the number of unique target words reaches the predefined threshold ? . The accumulated vocabulary will be used for this partition of the corpus during training. We repeat this until the end of the training set is reached. Let us refer to the subset of target words used for the i-th partition by V ? i . This may be understood as having a separate proposal distribution Q i for each partition of the training corpus. The distribution Q i assigns equal probability mass to all the target words included in the subset V ? i , and zero probability mass to all the other words, i.e., Q i (y k ) = ? ? ? 1 | V ? i | if y t ? V ? i 0 otherwise. This choice of proposal distribution cancels out the correction term ? logQ(y k ) from the importance weight in Eqs. (10)?(11), which makes the proposed approach equivalent to approximating the exact output probability in Eq. (6) with p(y t | y &lt;t , x) = exp { w &gt; t ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ) + b t } ? k:y k ?V ? exp { w &gt; k ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ) + b k } . It should be noted that this choice of Q makes the estimator biased. The proposed procedure results in speed up against usual importance sampling, asit exploits the advantage of modern computers in doing matrix-matrix vs matrix-vector multiplications. 4 3.1.1 Informal Discussion on Consequence The parametrization of the output probability in Eq. (6) can be understood as arranging the vectors associated with the target words such that the dot product between the most likely, or correct, target word?s vector and the current hidden state is maximized. The exponentiation followed by normalization is simply a process in which the dot products are converted into proper probabilities. As learning continues, therefore, the vectors of all the likely target words tend to align with each other but not with the others. This is achieved exactly by moving the vector of the correct word in the direction of ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ), while pushing all the other vectors away, which happens when the gradient of the logarithm of the exact output probability in Eq. (6) is maximized. Our approximate approach, instead, moves the word vectors of the correct words and of only a subset of sampled target words (those included in V ? ). 3.2 Decoding Once the model is trained using the proposed approximation, we can use the full target vocabulary when decoding a translation given a new source sentence. Although this is advantageous as it allows the trained model to utilize the whole vocabulary when generating a translation, doing so may be too computationally expensive, e.g., for realtime applications. Since training puts the target word vectors in the space so that they align well with the hidden state of the decoder only when they are likely to be a correct word, we can use only a subset of candidate target words during decoding. This is similar to what we do during training, except that at test time, we do not have access to a set of correct target words. The most na??ve way to select a subset of candidate target words is to take only the top-K most frequent target words, where K can be adjusted to meet the computational requirement. This, however, effectively cancels out the whole purpose of training a model with a very large target vocabulary. Instead, we can use an existing word alignment model to align the source and target words in the training corpus and build a dictionary. With the dictionary, for each source sentence, we construct a target word set consisting of the K-most frequent words (according to the estimated unigram probability) and, using the dictionary, at most K ? likely target words for each source word. K and K ? may be chosen either to meet the computational requirement or to maximize the translation performance on the development set. We call a subset constructed in either of these ways a candidate list. 3.3 Source Words for Unknown Words In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed approach with the neural machine translation model called RNNsearch (Bahdanau et al, 2015) (see Sec. 2.1.1). In this model, as a part of decoding process, we obtain the alignments between the target words and source locations via the alignment model inEq. (5). We can use this feature to infer the source word to which each target word was most aligned (indicated by the largest ? t in Eq. (5)). This is especially useful when the model generated an [UNK] token. Once a translation is generated given a source sentence, each [UNK] may be replaced using a translation-specific technique based on the aligned source word. For instance, in the experiment, we try replacing each [UNK] token with the aligned source word or its most likely translation determined by another word alignment model. Other techniques such as transliteration may also be used to further improve the performance (Koehn, 2010). 4 Experiments We evaluate the proposed approach in English?French and English?German translation tasks. We trained the neural machine translation models using only the bilingual, parallel corpora made available as a part of WMT?14. For each pair, the datasets we used are: ? English?French: 2 ?

To ensure fair comparison, the English?French corpus, which comprises approximately 12 million sentences, is identical to the one used in (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Bahdanau et al, 2015; Sutskever et al, 2014). As for English?German, the corpus was preprocessed, in a manner similar to (Peitz et al, 2014; Li et al, 2014), in order to remove many poorly translated sentences. We evaluate the models on the WMT?14 test set (news-test 2014), 3 while the concatenation of news-test-2012 and news-test-2013 is used for model selection (development set). Table 1 presents data coverage w.r.t. the vocabulary size, on the target side. Unless mentioned otherwise, all reported BLEU scores (Papineni et al, 2002) are computed with the multi-bleu.perl script 4 on the cased tokenized translations. 4.1 Settings As a baseline for English?French translation, we use the RNNsearch model proposed by (Bahdanau et al, 2015), with 30k source and target words. 5 Another RNNsearch model is trained for English?German translation with 50k source and target words. For each language pair, we train another set of RNNsearch models with much larger vocabularies of 500k source and target words, using the proposed approach. We call these models RNNsearch-LV. We vary the size of the shortlist used during training (? in Sec. 3.1). We tried 3 To compare with previous submissions, we use the filtered test sets. 4 https://github.com/moses-smt/ mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/ generic/multi-bleu.perl 5 The authors of (Bahdanau et al, 2015) gave us access to their trained models. We chose the best one on the validation set and resumed training. 15k and 30k for English?French, and 15k and 50k for English?German. We later report the results for thebest performance on the development set, with models generally evaluated every twelve hours. The training speed is approximately the same as for RNNsearch. Using a 780 Ti or Titan Black GPU, we could process 100k mini-batches of 80 sentences in about 29 and 39 hours respectively for ? = 15k and ? = 50k. For both language pairs, we also trained new models, with ? = 15k and ? = 50k, by reshuffling the dataset at the beginning of each epoch. While this causes a non-negligible amount of overhead, such a change allows words to be contrasted with different sets of other words each epoch. To stabilize parameters other than the word embeddings, at the end of the training stage, we freeze the word embeddings and tune only the other parameters for approximately two more days after the peak performance on the development set is observed. This helped increase BLEU scores on the development set. We use beam search to generate a translation given a source. During beam search, we keep a set of 12 hypotheses and normalize probabilities by the length of the candidate sentences, as in (Cho et al, 2014a). 6 The candidate list is chosen to maximize the performance on the development set, for K ? {15k, 30k, 50k} and K ? ? {10, 20}. As explained in Sec. 3.2, we test using a bilingual dictionary to accelerate decoding and to replace unknown words in translations. The bilingual dictionary is built using fast align (Dyer et al., 2013). We use the dictionary only if a word starts with a lowercase letter, and otherwise, we copy the source word directly. This led to better performance on the development sets. Note on ensembles For each language pair, we began training four models from each of which two points corresponding to the best and secondbest performance on the development set were collected. We continued training from each point, while keeping the word embeddings fixed, until the best development performance was reached, and took the model at this point as a single model in an ensemble. This procedure resulted in a total of eight models from which we averaged the length-normalized log-probabilities. Since much of training had been shared, the composition of 6 These experimental details differ from (Bahdanau et al, 2015). 6 RNNsearch RNNsearch-LV Google Phrase-based SMT Basic NMT 29.97 (26.58) 32.68 (28.76) 30.6 ? 33.3 ? 37.03 ? +Candidate List ? 33.36 (29.32) ? +UNK Replace 33.08 (29.08) 34.11 (29.98) 33.1 ? +Reshuffle (?=50k) ? 34.60 (30.53) ? +Ensemble ? 37.19 (31.98) 37.5 ?

RNNsearch is the model proposed in (Bahdanau et al, 2015), RNNsearch-LV is the RNNsearch trained with the approach proposed in this paper, and Google is the LSTM-based model proposed in (Sutskever et al,2014). Unless mentioned otherwise, we report singlemodel RNNsearch-LV scores using ? = 30k (English?French) and ? = 50k (English?German). For the experiments we have run ourselves, we show the scores on the development set as well in the brackets. (?) (Sutskever et al, 2014), (?) (Luong et al, 2015), (?) (Durrani et al, 2014), (?) Standard Moses Setting (Cho et al, 2014b), (\\x05) (Buck et al, 2014). such ensembles may be sub-optimal. This is supported by the fact that higher cross-model BLEU scores (Freitag et al, 2014) are observed for models that were partially trained together. 4.2 Translation Performance In Table 2, we present the results obtained by the trained models with very large target vocabularies, and alongside them, the previous results reported in (Sutskever et al, 2014), (Luong et al, 2015), (Buck et al, 2014) and (Durrani et al, 2014). Without translation-specific strategies, we can clearly see that the RNNsearch-LV outperforms the baseline RNNsearch. In the case of the English?French task, RNNsearch-LV approached the performance level of the previous best single neural machine translation (NMT) model, even without any translationspecific techniques (Sec. 3.2?3.3). With these, however, the RNNsearch-LV outperformed it. The performance of the RNNsearch-LV is also better than that of a standard phrase-based translation system (Cho et al, 2014b). Furthermore, by combining 8 models, we were able to achieve a translation performance comparable to the state of the art, measured in BLEU. For English?German, the RNNsearch-LV outperformed the baseline before unknown word replacement, but after doing so, the two systems performed similarly. We could reach higher largevocabulary single-model performance by reshuffling the dataset, but this step could potentially also help the baseline. In this case, we were able to surpass the previously reported best translation result on this task by building an ensemble of 8 models. With ? = 15k, the RNNsearch-LV performance worsened a little, with best BLEU scores, without reshuffling, of 33.76 and 18.59 respectively for English?French and English?German. The English?German ensemble described in this paper has also been used for the shared translation task of the 10 th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT?15), where it was ranked first in terms of BLEU score. The translations by this ensemble can be found online. 7 4.3 Analysis 4.3.1 Decoding Speed In Table 3, we present the timing information of decoding for different models. Clearly, decoding from RNNsearch-LV with the full target vocab7 http://matrix.statmt.org/matrix/ output/1774?run_id=4079 7 CPU ? GPU ?

GTX TITAN Black ulary is slowest. If we use a candidate list for decoding each translation, the speed of decoding substantially improves and becomes close to the baseline RNNsearch. A potential issue with using a candidate list is that for each source sentence, we must re-build a target vocabulary andsubsequently replace a part of the parameters, which may easily become timeconsuming. We can address this issue, for instance, by building a common candidate list for multiple source sentences. By doing so, we were able to match the decoding speed of the baseline RNNsearch model. 4.3.2 Decoding Target Vocabulary For English?French (? = 30k), we evaluate the influence of the target vocabulary when translating the test sentences by using the union of a fixed set of 30k common words and (at most) K ? likely candidates for each source word according to the dictionary. Results are presented in Figure 1. With K ? = 0 (not shown), the performance of the system is comparable to the baseline when not replacing the unknown words (30.12), but there is not as much improvement when doing so (31.14). As the large vocabulary model does not predict [UNK] as much during training, it is less likely to generate it when decoding, limiting the effectiveness of the post-processing step in this case. With K ? = 1, which limits the diversity of allowed uncommon words, BLEU is not as good as with moderately larger K ? , which indicates that our models can, to some degree, correctly choose between rare alternatives. If we rather use K = 50k, as we did for testing based on validation performance, the improvement over K ? = 1 is approximately 0.2 BLEU. When validating the choice of K, we found it to be correlated with the value of ? used during 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 K? 32.8 33.0 33.2 33.4 33.6 33.8 34.0 34.2 B L E U s c o r e With UNK replacement Without UNK replacement Figure 1: Single-model test BLEU scores (English?French) with respect to the number of dictionary entries K ? allowed for each source word. training. For example, on the English?French validation set, with ? = 15k (and K ? = 10), the BLEU score is 29.44 with K = 15k, but drops to 29.19 and 28.84 respectively for K = 30k and 50k. For ? = 30k, the score increases moderately from K = 15k to K = 50k. A similar effect was observed for English?German and on the test sets. As our implementation of importance sampling does not apply the usual correction to the gradient, it seems beneficial for the test vocabularies to resemble those used during training.5 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a way to extend the size of the target vocabulary for neural machine translation. The proposed approach allows us to train a model with much larger target vocabulary without any substantial increase in computational complexity. It is based on the earlier work in (Bengio and S?en?ecal, 2008) which used importance sampling to reduce the complexity of computing the normalization constant of the output word probability in neural language models. On English?French and English?German translation tasks, we observed that the neural machine translation models trained using the proposed method performed as well as, or better than, those using only limited sets of target words, even when replacing unknown words. As performance of the RNNsearch-LV models increased when only a selected subset of the target vocabulary was used during decoding, this makes the proposed learning algorithm more practical. When measured by BLEU, our models showed translation performance comparable to the 8 state-of-the-art translation systems on both the English?French task and English?German task. On the English?French task, a model trained with the proposed approach outperformed the best single neural machine translation (NMT) model from (Luong et al, 2015) by approximately 1 BLEU point. The performance of the ensemble of multiple models, despite its relatively less diverse composition, is approximately 0.3 BLEU points away from the best system (Luong et al, 2015). On the English?German task, the best performance of 21.59 BLEU by our model is higher than that of the previous state of the art (20.67) reported in (Buck et al, 2014). Finally, we release the source code used in our experiments to encourage progress in neural machine translation. 8 Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the developers of Theano (Bergstra et al, 2010; Bastien et al, 2012).

       "      <th>b'1 In t roduct ion   Parallel texts have been used in a number of studies  in computational linguistics. Brown et al (1993)  defined a series of probabilistic translation models  for MT purposes. While people may question the  effectiveness of using these models for a full-blown  MT system, the models are certainly valuable for de-  veloping translation assistance tools. For example,  we can use such a translation model to help com-  plete target ext being drafted by a human transla-  tor (Langlais et al, 2000).  Another utilization is in cross-language informa-  tion retrieval (CLIR) where queries have to be trans-  lated from one language to another language in  which the documents are written. In CLIR, the qual-  ity requirement for translation is relatively low. For  example, the syntactic aspect is irrelevant. Even if  the translated word is not a true translation but is  strongly related to the original query, it is still help-  ful. Therefore, CLIR is a suitable application for  such a translation model.  However, a major obstacle to this approach is the  lack of parallel corpora for model training. Only  a few such corpora exist, including the Hansard  English-French corpus and the HKUST English-  Chinese corpus (Wu, 1994). In this paper, we will  describe a method which automatically searches for  parallel texts on the Web. We will discuss the text  mining algorithm we adopted, some issues in trans-  lation model training using the generated parallel  corpus, and finally the translation model\\'s perfor-  mance in CLIR.  2 Para l le l  Text  M in ing  A lgor i thm  The PTMiner system is an intelligent Web agent  that is designed to search for large amounts of paral-  lel text on the Web. The mining algorithm is largely  language independent. It can thus be adapted to  other language pairs with only minor modifications.  Taking advantage ofWeb search engines as much  as possible, PTMiner implements he following steps  (illustrated in Fig. 1):  1 Search for candidate sites - Using existing Web  search engines, search for the candidate sites  that may contain parallel pages;  2 File name fetching - For each candidate site,  fetch the URLs of Web pages that are indexed  by the search engines;  3 Host crawling - Starting from the URLs col-  lected in the previous tep, search through each  candidate site separately for more URLs;  4 Pair scan - From the obtained URLs of each  site, scan for possible parallel pairs;  5 Download and verifying - Download the parallel  pages, determine file size, language, and charac-  ter set of each page, and filter out non-parallel  pairs.  2.1 Search for candidate Sites  We take advantage of the huge number of Web sites  indexed by existing search engines in determining candidate sites. This is done by submitting some  particular equests to the search engines. The re-  quests are determined according to the following ob-  servations. In the sites where parallel text exists,  there are normally some pages in one language con-  taining links to the parallel version in the other lan-  guage. These are usually indicated by those links\\'  anchor texts 1. For example, on some English page  there may be a link to its Chinese version with  the anchor text \"Chinese Version\" or \"in Chinese\".  1An anchor text  is a piece of text on a Web page which,  when clicked on, will take you to another linked page. To  be helpful, it usual ly  contains the key information about the  l inked page.  21  Figure 1: The workflow of the mining process.  The same phenomenon can be observed on Chinese  pages. Chances are that a site with parallel texts  will contain such links in some of its documents.  This fact is used as the criterion in searching for  candidate sites.  Therefore, to determine possible sites for English-  Chinese parallel texts, we can request an English  document containing the following anchor:  anchor : \"engl ish version H \\\\[\"in english\", ...\\\\].  Similar requests are sent for Chinese documents.  From the two sets of pages obtained by the above  queries we extract wo sets of Web sites. The union  of these two sets constitutes then the candidate sites.  That  is to say, a site is a candidate site when it  is found to have either an English page linking to  its Chinese version or a Chinese page linking to its  English version.  2.2 File Name Fetching  We now assume that a pair of parallel texts exists on  the same site. To search for parallel pairs on a site,  PTMiner first has to obtain all (or at least part of)  the HTML file names on the site. From these names  pairs are scanned. It is possible to use a Web crawler  to explore the candidate sites completely. However,  we can take advantage of the search engines again to  accelerate the process. As the first step, we submit  the following query to the search engines:  host : hostname  to fetch the Web pages that they indexed from this  site. If we only require a small amount of parallel  texts, this result may be sufficient. For our purpose,  however, we need to explore the sites more thor-  oughly using a host crawler. Therefore, we continue  our search for files with a host crawler which uses  the documents found by the search engines as the  starting point.  2.3 Host Crawling  A host crawler is slightly different from a Web  crawler. Web crawlers go through innumerable  pages and hosts on theWeb. A host crawler is a  Web crawler that crawls through documents on a  given host only. A breadth-first crawling algorithm  is applied in PTMiner as host crawler. The principle  is that when a link to an unexplored ocument on  the same site is found in a document, it is added to  a list that will be explored later. In this way, most  file names from the candidate sites are obtained.  2.4 Pair Scan  After collecting file names for each candidate site,  the next task is to determine the parallel pairs.  Again, we try to use some heuristic rules to guess  which files may be parallel texts before downloading  them. The rules are based on external features of  the documents. By external feature, we mean those  features which may be known without analyzing the  contents of the file, such as its URL, size, and date.  This is in contrast with the internal features, such as  language, character set, and HTML structure, which  cannot be known until we have downloaded the page  and analyzed its contents.  The heuristic criterion comes from the following  observation: We observe that parallel text pairs usu-  ally have similar name patterns. The difference be-  tween the names of two parailel pages usually lies  in a segment which indicates the language. For ex-  ample, \"file-ch.html\" (in Chinese) vs. \"file-en.html\"  (in English). The difference may also appear in the  path, such as \".../chinese/.../fi le.html\" vs. \".../en-  glish/.../f i le.html\\'. The name patterns described  above are commonly used by webmasters to help or-  ganize their sites. Hence, we can suppose that a  pair of pages with this kind of pattern are probably  parallel texts.  22 First, we establish four lists for English pre-  fixes, English suffixes, Chinese prefixes and Chi-  nese suffixes. For example: Engl ish P re f ix  =  {e, en, e_, en_, e - ,  en - ,  ...}. For each file in one lan-  guage, if a segment in its name corresponds to one  of the language affixes, several new names are gener-  ated by changing the segment to the possible corre-  sponding affixes of the other language. If a generated  name corresponds to an existing file, then the file is  considered as a candidate parallel document of the  original file.  2.5 Filtering  Next, we further examine the contents of the paired  files to determine if they are really parallel according  to various external and internal features. This may  further improve the pairing precision. The following  methods have been implemented in our system.  2.5.1 Text Length  Parallel files often have similar file lengths. One sim-  ple way to filter out incorrect pairs is to compare  the lengths of the two files. The only problem is to  set a reasonablethreshold that will not discard too  many good pairs, i.e. balance recall and precision.  The usual difference ratio depends on the language  pairs we are dealing with. For example, Chinese-  English parallel texts usually have a larger differ-  ence ratio than English-French parallel texts. The  filtering threshold had to be determined empirically,  from the actual observations. For Chinese-English,  a difference up to 50% is tolerated.  2.5.2 Language and  Character Set  It is also obvious that the two files of a pair have  to be in the two languages of interest. By auto-  matically identifying language and character set, we  can filter out the pairs that do not satisfy this basic  criterion. Some Web pages explicitly indicate the  language and the character set. More often such  information is omitted by authors. We need some  language identification tool for this task.  SILC is a language and encoding identification  system developed by the RALI laboratory at the  University of Montreal. It employs a probabilistic  model estimated on tri-grams. Using these mod-  els, the system is able to determine the most proba-  ble language and encoding of a text (Isabelle et al,  1997).  2.5.3 HTML Structure and Alignment  In the STRAND system (Resnik, 1998), the candi-  date pairs are evaluated by aligning them according  to their HTML structures and computing confidence  values. Pairs are assumed to be wrong if they have  too many mismatching markups or low confidence  values.  Comparing HTML structures seems to be a sound  way to evaluate candidate pairs since parallel pairs  usually have similar HTML structures. However, we  also noticed that parallel texts may have quite dif-  ferent HTML structures. One of the reasons is that  the two files may be created using two HTML ed-  itors. For example, one may be used for English  and another for Chinese, depending on the language  handling capability of the editors. Therefore, cau-  tion is required when measuring structure difference  numerically.  Parallel text alignment is still an experimental  area. Measuring the confidence values of an align-  ment is even more complicated. For example, the  alignment algorithm we used in the training of the  statistical translation model produces acceptable  alignment results but it does not provide a confi-  dence value that we can \"confidently\" use as an eval-  uation criterion. So, for the moment his criterion is  not used in candidate pair evaluation.  3 Generated  Corpus  and Trans la t ion   Mode l  Tra in ing   In this section, we describe the results of our parallel  text mining and translation model training.  3.1 The Corpus  Using the above approach for Chinese-English, 185  candidate sites were searched from the domain hk.  We limited the mining domain to hk because Hong  Kongis a bilingual English-Chinese city where high  quality parallel Web sites exist. Because of the small  number of candidate sites, the host crawler was used  to thoroughly explore each site. The resulting cor-  pus contains 14820 pairs of texts including 117.2Mb  Chinese texts and 136.5Mb English texts. The entire  mining process lasted about a week. Using length  comparison and language identification, we refined  the precision of the corpus to about 90%. The preci-  sion is estimated by examining 367 randomly picked  pairs.  3.2 Statistical Translation Model  Many approaches in computational linguistics try to  extract ranslation knowledge from previous trans-  lation examples. Most work of this kind establishes  probabilistic models from parallel corpora. Based  on one of the statistical models proposed by Brown  et al (1993), the basic principle of our translation  model is the following: given a corpus of aligned sen-  tences, if two words often co-occur in the source and  target sentences, there is a good likelihood that they  are translations of each other. In the simplest case  (model 1), the model earns the probability, p(tls), of  having a word t in the translation of a sentence con-  taining a word s. For an input sentence, the model  then calculates a sequence of words that are most  probable to appear in its translation. Using a sim-  ilar statistical model, Wu (1995) extracted a large-  scale English-Chinese l xicon from the HKUST cor-  23   &lt;s id=\"00~\"&gt;  &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;  &lt;META HTrP-EQUIV=\"Content-type\"  CONTENT=\"text/html; charset--iso-8859-1\"&gt;  &lt;META HTI\\'P-EQUIV=\"Content-language\"  CONTENT=\"Western\"&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0001\"&gt;  &lt;TITLE&gt;Journal of Primary Education 1996,  VoI., No. l&amp;2, pp. 19-27 &lt;/TITLE&gt;  &lt;/HEAD&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0002\"&gt;  &lt;BODY BACKGROUND=\".Jgif/pejbg.jpg\"  TEXT=\"#000(3(O\" BGCOLOR=\"#ffffff\"&gt;  &lt;CENTER&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0003\"&gt;  &lt;HI&gt;Journal of Primary Education &lt;/HI&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0004\"&gt;  &lt;HR&gt; &lt;B&gt;Volume 6, No l&amp;2, pp. 19-27 (May,  1996) &lt;/B&gt; &lt;HR&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0005\"&gt;  &lt;H3&gt;Principles for Redesigning Teacher  Education &lt;/H3&gt; Alan TOM &lt;/CENTER&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0006\"&gt;  &lt;P&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;I&gt; Abstract &lt;/I&gt; &lt;/B&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0000\"&gt;  &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;  &lt;META H\\'ITP-EQUW=\"Content-type\"  CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=bigS\"&gt;  &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-language\"  CONTENT=\"zh\"&gt;  &lt;Is&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0001\"&gt;  &lt;TITLE&gt; Journal of Primary Education 1996,  Vol., No. l&amp;2, Page 19-27 &lt;/TITLE&gt;  &lt;/HEAD&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0002\"&gt;  &lt;BODY BACKGROUND=\".Jgif/pejbg.jpg\"  TEXT=\"#000000\" BGCOLOR=\"#ffffff\"&gt; &lt;A  HREF=\"/erdpej/b2g__pej.phtml?URL=%2fen%2fp  ej%2f0601%2f0601019c.htm\"&gt;  &lt;IMG SRC=\"/en/gif/kan.gif\" ALT=\"~\"   BORDER=0 ALIGN=R IGHT&gt; &lt;/A&gt; &lt;CENTER&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0003\"&gt;  &lt;H2&gt;~ ~ 11I ~ O.&lt;/H2&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0004\"&gt;  &lt;HR&gt; (~:~h-fv-c?.JLJl) ~,-\\\\]\\'?~..  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0005\"&gt;  ~ 19-27\\\\]~ &lt;I-1R&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  Figure 2: An alignment example using pure length-based method.  pus which is built manually. In our case, the prob-  abilistic translation model will be used for CLIR.  The requirement on our translation model may be  less demanding: itis not absolutely necessary that  a word t with high p(tls ) always be a true trans-  lation of s. It is still useful if t is strongly related  to s. For example, although \"railway\" is not a true  translation of \"train\" (in French), it is highly useful  to include \"railway\" in the translation of a query on  \"train\". This is one of the reasons why we think a  less controlled parallel corpus can be used to train a  translation model for CLIR.  3.3 Parallel Text Al ignment  Before the mined documents can be aligned into par-  allel sentences, the raw texts have to undergo a se-  ries of some preprocessing, which, to some extent, is  language dependent. For example, the major opera-  tions on the Chinese-English corpus include encod-  ing scheme transformation (for Chinese), sentence  level segmentation, parallel text alignment, Chinese  word segmentation (Nie et al, 1999) and English  expression extraction.  The parallel Web pages we collected from vari-  ous sites are not all of the same quality. Some are  highly parallel and easy to align while others can be  very noisy. Aligning English-Chinese parallel texts  is already very difficult because of the great differ-  ences in the syntactic structures and writing sys-  tems of the two languages. A number of alignment  techniques have been proposed, varying from statis-  tical methods (Brown et al, 1991; Gale and Church,  1991) to lexical methods (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993;  Chen, 1993). The method we adopted is that of  Simard et al (1992). Because it considers both  length similarity and cognateness as alignment cri-  teria, the method is more robust and better able  to deal with noise than pure length-based methods.  Cognates are identical sequences of characters in cor-  responding words in two languages. They are com-  monly found in English and French. In the case of  English-Chinese alignment, where there are no cog-  nates shared by the two languages, only the HTML  markup in both texts are taken as cognates. Be-  cause the HTML structures of parallel pages are nor-  mally similar, the markup was found to be helpful  for alignment.  To illustrate how markup can help with the align-  ment, we align the same pair with both the pure  length-based method of Gale &amp; Church (Fig. 2),  and the method of Simard et al (Fig. 3). First of  all, we observe from the figures that the two texts are  24 &lt;s id=\"0000\"&gt;  &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;  &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-type\"  CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 \"&gt;  &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-language\"  CONTENT=\"Westem\"&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0001\"&gt;  &lt;TITLE&gt;Journal of Primary Education 1996,  Vol., No. l&amp;2, pp. 19-27 &lt;/TITLE&gt;  &lt;/HEAD&gt;  &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;s id=\"0002\"&gt;  &lt;BODY BACKGROUND=-\".

The sentences are marked by  &lt;s id=\"xxxx\"&gt; and &lt;/s&gt;.  Note that we determine  sentences not only by periods, but also by means of  HTML markup.  We further notice that it is difficult to align sen-  tences 0002. The sentence in the Chinese page is  much longer than its counterpart in the English page  because some additional information (font) is added.  The length-based method thus tends to take sen-  tence 0002, 0003, and 0004 in the English page as  the translation of sentence 0002 in the Chinese page  (Fig. 2), which is wrong. This in turn provocated  the three following incorrect alignments. As we can  see in Fig. 3, the cognate method did not make the  same mistake because of the noise in sentence 0002.  Despite their large length difference, the two 0002  sentences are still aligned as a 1-1 pair, because the  sentences in the following 4 alignments (0003 - 0003;  0004 - 0004, 0005; 0005 - 0006; 0006 - 0007) have  rather similar HTML markups and are taken by the  program to be the most likely alignments.  Beside HTML markups, other criteria may also  be incorporated. For example, it would be helpful  to consider strong correspondence b tween certain  English and Chinese words, as in (Wu, 1994). We  hope to implement such correspondences in our fu-  ture research.  3.4 Lex icon  Eva luat ion   To evaluate the precision of the English-Chinese  translation model trained on the Web corpus, we  examined two sample lexicons of 200 words, one in  each direction. The 200 words for each lexicon were  randomly selected from the training source. We ex-  amined the most probable translation for each word.  The Chinese-English lexicon was found to have a  precision of 77%. The English-Chinese l xicon has a higher precision of 81.5%. Part of the lexicons  are shown in Fig. 4, where t / f  indicates whether a  translation is true or false.  These precisions seem to be reasonably high.  They are quite comparable to that obtained by Wu  (1994) using a manual Chinese-English parallel cor-  pus.  3.5 Effect  o f  S topwords   We also found that stop-lists have significant effect  on the translation model. Stop-list is a set of the  most frequent words that we remove from the train-  2fi  English word  a .n l .   access  adaptation  add  adopt  agent  agree  airline  amendment  , appliance  apply  attendance  auditor  - ,average  base_on  t/f  t  f  t  t  t  t  t  t  t  t  t  t  f  t  f  Translmion Probability Chinese word  ~\\'~- 0.201472 ~t l :   ~\"  0.071705 \"~\"   ~f~.,~ 0.179633 JllL~  0.317435  ~ 0.231637 ~.~  1~tA~ 0.224902 4J~\\'~  0.36569  0.344001  0.367518  J~ 4~ 0.136319  i~.~I 0.19448 J~   ~\\',1~ 0.171769 ,~- JJ~  *~ 0.15011 -~-~  ~- ~ 0.467646 * *~  0.107304  Figure 4: Part of the evaluation lexicons.  t/f  t  t  t  t  t  f  t  f  t  t  t  t  t  t  t  Translation Probability  office 0.375868  protection 0.343071  report 0.358592  prepare 0.189513  loca l  0.421837  follow 0.023685  standard 0.445453  adu l t  0.044959  inadequate 0.093012  part 0.313676  financial 0.16608  visit 0.309642  bill 0.401997  vehicle 0.467034  saving 0.176695  Figure 5: Effect of stop lists in C-E translation.  ing source. Because these words exist in most align-  ments, the statistical model cannot derive correct  translations for them. More importantly, their ex-  istence greatly affects the accuracy of other transla-  tions. They can be taken as translations for many  words.  A priori, it would seem that both the English and  Chinese stop-lists hould be applied to eliminate the  noise caused by them. Interestingly, from our ob-  servation and analysis we concluded that for better  precision, only the stop-list of the target language  should be applied in the model training.  We first explain why the stop-list of the target lan-  guage has to be applied. On the left side of Fig. 5,  if the Chinese word C exists in the same alignments  with the English word E more than any other Chi-  nese words, C will be the most probable translation  for E. Because of their frequent appearance, some  Chinese stopwords may have more chances tobe in  the same alignments with E. The probability of the  translation E --+ C is then reduced (maybe ven less  than those of the incorrect ones). This is the reason  why many English words are translated to \"~ \\'  (of)  by the translation model trained without using the  Chinese stop-list.  We also found that it is not necessary to remove  the stopwords of the source language. In fact, as il-  lustrated on the right side of Fig. 5, the existence of  the English stopwords has two effects on the proba-  bility of the translation E -~ C:  1 They may often be found together with the Chi-  nese word C. Owing to the Expectation Maxi-  mization algorithm, the probability of E -~ C  may therefore be reduced.  2 On the other hand, there is a greater likelihood  that English stopwords will be found together  with the most frequent Chinese words. Here,  we use the term \"Chinese frequent words\" in-  stead of \"Chinese stopwords\" because ven if a  stop-list is applied, there may still remain some  common words that have the same effect as the  stopwords. The coexistence ofEnglish and Chi-  nese frequent words reduces the probability that  the Chinese frequent words are the translations  of E, and thus raise the probability of E -+ C.  The second effect was found to be more signifi-  cant than the first, since the model trained without  the English stopwords has better precision than the  model trained with the English stopwords. For the  correct ranslations given by both models, the model  26 Mono-Lingual IR  Translation Model  Dictionary  C-E CLIR  0.3861  0.1504 (39.0%mono)  0.1530 (39.6%mono)  0.2583 (66.9%mono)  E-C CLIR  0.3976  0.1841 (46.3%mono)  0.1427 (35.9%mono)  0.2232 (56.1%mono)  Table 1: CLIR results.  trained without considering the English stopwords  gives higher probabilities.  4 Eng l i sh -Ch inese  CL IR  Resu l ts   Our final goal was to test the performance of the  translation models trained on the Web parallel cor-  pora in CLIR. We conducted CLIR experiments u -  ing the Smart IR system.  4.1 Results   The English test corpus (for C-E CLIR) was the  AP corpus used in TREC6 and TREC7. The short  English queries were translated manually into Chi-  nese and then translated back to English by the  translation model. The Chinese test corpus was the  one used in the TREC5 and TREC6 Chinese track.  It contains both Chinese queries and their English  translations.  Our experiments on these two corpora produced  the results hown in Tab. 1. The precision of mono-  lingual IR is given as benchmark. In both E-C and  C-E CLIR, the translation model achieved around  40% of monolingual precision. To comparewith the  dictionary-based approach, we employed a Chinese-  English dictionary, CEDICT (Denisowski, 1999),  and an English-Chinese online dictionary (Anony-  mous, 1999a) to translate queries. For each word  of the source query, all the possible translations  given by the dictionary are included in the translated  query. The Chinese-English dictionary has about  the same performace as the translation model, while  the English-Chinese dictionary has lower precision  than that of the translation model.  We also tried to combine the translations given by  the translation model and the dictionary. In both  C-E and E-C CLIR, significant improvements were  achieved (as shown in Tab. 1). The improvements  show that the translations given by the translation  model and the dictionary complement each other  well for IR purposes. The translation model may  give either exact ranslations orincorrect but related  words. Even though these words are not correct in  the sense of translation, they are very possibly re-  lated to the subject of the query and thus helpful  for IR purposes. The dictionary-based approach ex-  pands a query along another dimension. It gives  all the possible translations for each word including  those that are missed by the translation model.  4.2 Comparison Wi th  MT Systems  One advantage of a parallel text-based translation  model is that it is easier to build than an MT system.  Now that we have examined the CLIR performance  of the translation model, we will compare it with  two existing MT systems. Both systems were tested  in E-C CLIR.  4.2.1 Sunshine WebTran Server  Using the Sunshine WebTran server (Anonymous,  1999b), an online Engiish-Chinese MT system, to  translate the 54 English queries, we obtained an  average precision of 0.2001, which is 50.3% of the  mono-lingual precision. The precision is higher than  that obtained using the translation model (0.1804)  or the dictionary (0.1427) alone, but lower than the  precison obtained using them together (0.2232).  4.2.2 Transperfect  Kwok (1999) investigated the CLIR performance of an English-Chinese MT software called Transper-  fect, using the same TREC Chinese collection as we  used in this study. Using the MT software alone,  Kwok achieved 56% of monolingual precision. The  precision is improved to 62% by refining the trans-  lation with a dictionary. Kwok also adopted pre-  translation query expansion, which further improved  the precison to 70% of the monolingual results.  In our case, the best E-C CLIR precison using the  translation model (and dictionary) is 56.1%. It is  lower than what Kwok achieved using Transperfect,  however, the difference is not large.  4.3 Further  Problems  The Chinese-English translation model has a fax  lower CLIR performance than that of the English-  French model established using the same method  (Nie et al, 1999). The principal reason for this is the  fact that English and Chineseare much more differ-  ent than English and French. This problem surfaced  in many phases of this work, from text alignment to  query translation. Below, we list some further fac-  tors affecting CLIR precision.  ? The Web-collected corpus is noisy and it is dif-  ficult to align English-Chinese t xts. The align-  ment method we employed has performed more  poorly than on English-French alignment. This  in turn leads to poorer performance of the trans-  lation model. In general, we observe a higher  27  variability in Chinese-English translations than  in English-French translations.  ? For E-C CLIR, although queries in both lan-  guages were provided, the English queries were  not strictly translated from the original Chi-  nese ones. For example, A Jg ,~ (human right  situation) was translated into human right is-  sue. We cannot expect he translation model  to translate issue back to ~ (situation).  ? The training source and the CLIR collections  were from different domains. The Web cor-  pus are retrieved from the parallel sites in Hong  Kong while the Chinese collection is from Peo-  ple\\'s Daily and Xinhua News Agency, which are  published in mainland China. As the result,  some important erms such as ~$ $ (most-  favored-nation) and --- I!! ~ ~ (one-nation-two-  systems) in the collection are not known by the  model.  5 Summary   The goal of this work was to investigate he feasibil-  ity of using a statistical translation model trained on  a Web-collected corpus to do English-Chinese CLIR.  In this paper, we have described the algorithm and  implementation we used for parallel text mining,  translation model training, and some results we ob-  tained in CLIR experiments. Although further work  remains to be done, we can conclude that it is pos-  sible to automatically construct a Chinese-English  parallel corpus from the Web. The current system  can be easily adapted to other language pairs. De-  spite the noisy nature of the corpus and the great  difference in the languages, the evaluation lexicons  generated by the translation model produced accept-  able precision. While the current CLIR results are  not as encouraging asthose of English-French CLIR,  they could be improved in various ways, such as im-  proving the alignment method by adapting cognate  definitions to HTML markup, incorporating a lexi-  con and/or removing some common function words  in translated queries.  We hope to be able to demonstrate in the near  future that a fine-tuned English-Chinese translation  model can provide query translations for CLIR with  the same quality produced by MT systems.

       "  b'1 Introduction Neural machine translation (NMT) is a recently introduced approach to solving machine translation (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Bahdanau et al, 2015; Sutskever et al, 2014). In neural machine translation, one builds a single neural network that reads a source sentence and generates its translation. The whole neural network is jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a correct translation given a source sentence, using the bilingual corpus. The NMT models have shown to perform as well as the most widely used conventional translation systems (Sutskever et al, 2014; Bahdanau et al, 2015). Neural machine translation has a number of advantages over the existing statistical machine translation system, specifically, the phrase-based system (Koehn et al, 2003). First, NMT requires a minimal set of domain knowledge. For instance, all of the models proposed in (Sutskever et al, 2014), (Bahdanau et al, 2015) or (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013) do not assume any linguistic property in both source and target sentences except that they are sequences of words. Second, the whole system is jointly trained to maximize the translation performance, unlike the existing phrase-based system which consists of many separately trained features whose weights are then tuned jointly. Lastly, the memory footprint of the NMT model is often much smaller than the existing system which relies on maintaining large tables of phrase pairs. Despite these advantages and promising results, there is a major limitation in NMT compared to the existing phrase-based approach. That is, the number of target words must be limited. This is mainly because the complexity of training and using an NMT model increases as the number of target words increases. A usual practice is to construct a target vocabulary of the K most frequent words (a socalled shortlist), where K is often in the range of 30k (Bahdanau et al, 2015) to 80k (Sutskever et al., 2014). Any word not included in this vocabulary is mapped to a special token representing an unknown word [UNK]. This approach works well when there are only a few unknown words in the target sentence, but it has been observed 1 that the translation performance degrades rapidly as the number of unknown words increases (Cho et al, 2014a; Bahdanau et al, 2015). In this paper, we propose an approximate training algorithm based on (biased) importance sampling that allows us to train an NMT model with a much larger target vocabulary. The proposed algorithm effectively keeps the computational complexity during training at the level of using only a small subset of the full vocabulary. Once the model with a very large target vocabulary is trained, one can choose to use either all the target words or only a subset of them. We compare the proposed algorithm against the baseline shortlist-based approach in the tasks of English?French and English?German translation using the NMT model introduced in (Bahdanau et al, 2015). The empirical results demonstrate that we can potentially achieve better translation performance using larger vocabularies, and that our approach does not sacrifice too much speed for both training and decoding. Furthermore, we show that the modeltrained with this algorithm gets the best translation performance yet achieved by single NMT models on the WMT?14 English?French translation task. 2 Neural Machine Translation and Limited Vocabulary Problem In this section, we briefly describe an approach to neural machine translation proposed recently in (Bahdanau et al, 2015). Based on this description we explain the issue of limited vocabularies in neural machine translation. 2.1 Neural Machine Translation Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation, which uses a single neural network trained jointly to maximize the translation performance (Forcada and ? Neco, 1997; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014b; Sutskever et al, 2014; Bahdanau et al, 2015). Neural machine translation is often implemented as the encoder?decoder network. The encoder reads the source sentence x = (x 1 , . . . , x T ) and encodes it into a sequence of hidden states h = (h 1 , ? ? ? , h T ): h t = f (x t , h t?1 ) . (1) Then, the decoder, another recurrent neural network, generates a corresponding translation y = (y 1 , ? ? ? , y T ? ) based on the encoded sequence of hidden states h: p(y t | y <t , x) ? exp {q (y t?1 , z t , c t )} , (2) where z t = g (y t?1 , z t?1 , c t ) , (3) c t = r (z t?1 , h 1 , . . . , h T ) , (4) and y <t = (y 1 , . . . , y t?1 ). The whole model is jointly trained to maximize the conditional log-probability of the correct translation given a source sentence with respect to the parameters ? of the model: ? ? = argmax ? N ? n=1 T n ? t=1 log p(y n t | y n <t , x n ), where (x n , y n ) is the n-th training pair of sentences, and T n is the length of the n-th target sentence (y n ). 2.1.1 Detailed Description In this paper, we use a specific implementation of neural machine translation that uses an attention mechanism, as recently proposed in (Bahdanau et al., 2015). In (Bahdanau et al, 2015), the encoder in Eq. (1) is implemented by a bi-directional recurrent neural network such that h t = [ ?? h t ; ?? h t ] , where ?? h t = f ( x t , ?? h t+1 ) , ?? h t = f ( x t , ?? h t?1 ) . They used a gated recurrent unit for f (see, e.g., (Cho et al, 2014b)). The decoder, at each time, computes the context vector c t as a convex sum of the hidden states (h 1 , . . . , h T ) with the coefficients ? 1 , . . . , ? T computed by ? t = exp {a (h t , zt?1 )} ? k exp {a (h k , z t?1 )} , (5) where a is a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer. A new hidden state z t of the decoder in Eq. (3) is computed based on the previous hidden state z t?1 , previous generated symbol y t?1 and the computed 2 context vector c t . The decoder also uses the gated recurrent unit, as the encoder does. The probability of the next target word in Eq. (2) is then computed by p(y t | y <t , x) = 1 Z exp { w > t ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ) + b t } , (6) where ? is an affine transformation followed by a nonlinear activation, and w t and b t are respectively the target word vector and the target word bias. Z is the normalization constant computed by Z = ? k:y k ?V exp { w > k ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ) + b k } , (7) where V is the set of all the target words. For the detailed description of the implementation, we refer the reader to the appendix of (Bahdanau et al, 2015). 2.2 Limited Vocabulary Issue and Conventional Solutions One of the main difficulties in training this neural machine translation model is the computational complexity involved in computing the target word probability (Eq. (6)). More specifically, we need to compute the dot product between the feature ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ) and the word vector w t as many times as there are words in a target vocabulary in order to compute the normalization constant (the denominator in Eq. (6)). This has to be done for, on average, 20?30 words per sentence, which easily becomes prohibitively expensive even with a moderate number of possible target words. Furthermore, the memory requirement grows linearly with respect to the number of target words. This has been a major hurdle for neural machine translation, compared to the existing non-parametric approaches such as phrase-based translation systems. Recently proposed neural machine translation models, hence, use a shortlist of 30k to 80k most frequent words (Bahdanau et al, 2015; Sutskever et al, 2014). This makes training more feasible, but comes with a number of problems. First of all, the performance of the model degrades heavily if the translation of a source sentence requires many words that are not included in the shortlist (Cho et al, 2014a). This also affects the performance evaluation of the system which is often measured by BLEU. Second, the first issue becomes more problematic with languages that have a rich set of words such as German or other highly inflected languages. There are two model-specific approaches to this issue of large target vocabulary. The first approach is to stochastically approximate the target word probability. This has been proposed recently in (Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013; Mikolov et al, 2013) based on noise-contrastive estimation (Gutmann and Hyvarinen, 2010). In the second approach, thetarget words are clustered into multiple classes, or hierarchical classes, and the target probability p(y t |y <t , x) is factorized as a product of the class probability p(c t |y <t , x) and the intraclass word probability p(y t |c t , y <t , x). This reduces the number of required dot-products into the sum of the number of classes and the words in a class. These approaches mainly aim at reducing the computational complexity during training, but do not often result in speed-up when decoding a translation during test time. 1 Other than these model-specific approaches, there exist translation-specific approaches. A translation-specific approach exploits the properties of the rare target words. For instance, Luong et al proposed such an approach for neural machine translation (Luong et al, 2015). They replace rare words (the words that are not included in the shortlist) in both source and target sentences into corresponding ?OOV n ? tokens using the word alignment model. Once a source sentence is translated, each ?OOV n ? in the translation will be replaced based on the source word marked by the corresponding ?OOV n ?. It is important to note that the modelspecific approaches and the translation-specific approaches are often complementary and can be used together to further improve the translation performance and reduce the computational complexity. 3 Approximate Learning Approach to Very Large Target Vocabulary 3.1 Description In this paper, we propose a model-specific approach that allows us to train a neural machine translation model with a very large target vocabulary. With the proposed approach, the compu1 This is due to the fact that the beam search requires the conditional probability of every target word at each time step regardless of the parametrization of the output probability. 3 tational complexity of training becomes constant with respect to the size of the target vocabulary. Furthermore, the proposed approach allows us to efficiently use a fast computing device with limited memory, such as a GPU, to train a neural machine translation model with a much larger target vocabulary. As mentioned earlier, the computational inefficiency of training a neural machine translation model arises from the normalization constant in Eq. (6). In order to avoid the growing complexity of computing the normalization constant, we propose here to use only a small subset V ? of the target vocabulary at each update. The proposed approach is based on the earlier work of (Bengio and S?en?ecal, 2008). Let us consider the gradient of the logprobability of the output in Eq. (6). The gradient is composed of a positive and negative part: ? log p(y t | y <t , x) (8) =?E(y t )? ? k:y k ?V p(y k | y <t , x)?E(y k ), where we define the energy E as E(y j ) = w > j ? (y j?1 , z j , c j ) + b j . The second, or negative, term of the gradient is in essence the expected gradient of the energy: E P [?E(y)] , (9) where P denotes p(y| y <t , x). The main idea of the proposed approach is to approximate this expectation, or the negative term of the gradient, by importance sampling with a small number of samples. Given a predefined proposal distribution Q and a set V ? of samples from Q, we approximate the expectation in Eq. (9) with E P [?E(y)] ? ? k:y k ?V ? ? k ? k ? :y k ? ?V ? ? k ? ?E(y k ), (10) where ? k = exp {E(y k )? logQ(y k )} . (11) This approach allows us to compute the normalization constant during training using only a small subset of the target vocabulary, resulting in much lower computational complexity for each parameter update. Intuitively, at each parameter update, we update only the vectors associated with the correct word w t and with the sampled words in V ? . Once training is over, we can use the full target vocabulary to compute the output probability of each target word. Although the proposed approach naturally addresses the computational complexity, using this approach naively does not guarantee that the number of parameters being updated for each sentence pair, which includes multiple target words, is bounded nor can be controlled. This becomes problematic when training is done, for instance, on a GPU with limited memory. In practice, hence, we partition the training corpus and define a subset V ? of the target vocabulary for each partition prior to training. Before training begins, we sequentially examine each target sentence in the training corpus and accumulate unique target words until the number of unique target words reaches the predefined threshold ? . The accumulated vocabulary will be used for this partition of the corpus during training. We repeat this until the end of the training set is reached. Let us refer to the subset of target words used for the i-th partition by V ? i . This may be understood as having a separate proposal distribution Q i for each partition of the training corpus. The distribution Q i assigns equal probability mass to all the target words included in the subset V ? i , and zero probability mass to all the other words, i.e., Q i (y k ) = ? ? ? 1 | V ? i | if y t ? V ? i 0 otherwise. This choice of proposal distribution cancels out the correction term ? logQ(y k ) from the importance weight in Eqs. (10)?(11), which makes the proposed approach equivalent to approximating the exact output probability in Eq. (6) with p(y t | y <t , x) = exp { w > t ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ) + b t } ? k:y k ?V ? exp { w > k ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ) + b k } . It should be noted that this choice of Q makes the estimator biased. The proposed procedure results in speed up against usual importance sampling, asit exploits the advantage of modern computers in doing matrix-matrix vs matrix-vector multiplications. 4 3.1.1 Informal Discussion on Consequence The parametrization of the output probability in Eq. (6) can be understood as arranging the vectors associated with the target words such that the dot product between the most likely, or correct, target word?s vector and the current hidden state is maximized. The exponentiation followed by normalization is simply a process in which the dot products are converted into proper probabilities. As learning continues, therefore, the vectors of all the likely target words tend to align with each other but not with the others. This is achieved exactly by moving the vector of the correct word in the direction of ? (y t?1 , z t , c t ), while pushing all the other vectors away, which happens when the gradient of the logarithm of the exact output probability in Eq. (6) is maximized. Our approximate approach, instead, moves the word vectors of the correct words and of only a subset of sampled target words (those included in V ? ). 3.2 Decoding Once the model is trained using the proposed approximation, we can use the full target vocabulary when decoding a translation given a new source sentence. Although this is advantageous as it allows the trained model to utilize the whole vocabulary when generating a translation, doing so may be too computationally expensive, e.g., for realtime applications. Since training puts the target word vectors in the space so that they align well with the hidden state of the decoder only when they are likely to be a correct word, we can use only a subset of candidate target words during decoding. This is similar to what we do during training, except that at test time, we do not have access to a set of correct target words. The most na??ve way to select a subset of candidate target words is to take only the top-K most frequent target words, where K can be adjusted to meet the computational requirement. This, however, effectively cancels out the whole purpose of training a model with a very large target vocabulary. Instead, we can use an existing word alignment model to align the source and target words in the training corpus and build a dictionary. With the dictionary, for each source sentence, we construct a target word set consisting of the K-most frequent words (according to the estimated unigram probability) and, using the dictionary, at most K ? likely target words for each source word. K and K ? may be chosen either to meet the computational requirement or to maximize the translation performance on the development set. We call a subset constructed in either of these ways a candidate list. 3.3 Source Words for Unknown Words In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed approach with the neural machine translation model called RNNsearch (Bahdanau et al, 2015) (see Sec. 2.1.1). In this model, as a part of decoding process, we obtain the alignments between the target words and source locations via the alignment model inEq. (5). We can use this feature to infer the source word to which each target word was most aligned (indicated by the largest ? t in Eq. (5)). This is especially useful when the model generated an [UNK] token. Once a translation is generated given a source sentence, each [UNK] may be replaced using a translation-specific technique based on the aligned source word. For instance, in the experiment, we try replacing each [UNK] token with the aligned source word or its most likely translation determined by another word alignment model. Other techniques such as transliteration may also be used to further improve the performance (Koehn, 2010). 4 Experiments We evaluate the proposed approach in English?French and English?German translation tasks. We trained the neural machine translation models using only the bilingual, parallel corpora made available as a part of WMT?14. For each pair, the datasets we used are: ? English?French: 2 ? Common Crawl ? News Commentary ? Gigaword ? Europarl v7 ? UN ? English?German: ? Common Crawl ? News Commentary ?

To ensure fair comparison, the English?French corpus, which comprises approximately 12 million sentences, is identical to the one used in (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Bahdanau et al, 2015; Sutskever et al, 2014). As for English?German, the corpus was preprocessed, in a manner similar to (Peitz et al, 2014; Li et al, 2014), in order to remove many poorly translated sentences. We evaluate the models on the WMT?14 test set (news-test 2014), 3 while the concatenation of news-test-2012 and news-test-2013 is used for model selection (development set). Table 1 presents data coverage w.r.t. the vocabulary size, on the target side. Unless mentioned otherwise, all reported BLEU scores (Papineni et al, 2002) are computed with the multi-bleu.perl script 4 on the cased tokenized translations. 4.1 Settings As a baseline for English?French translation, we use the RNNsearch model proposed by (Bahdanau et al, 2015), with 30k source and target words. 5 Another RNNsearch model is trained for English?German translation with 50k source and target words. For each language pair, we train another set of RNNsearch models with much larger vocabularies of 500k source and target words, using the proposed approach. We call these models RNNsearch-LV. We vary the size of the shortlist used during training (? in Sec. 3.1). We tried 3 To compare with previous submissions, we use the filtered test sets. 4 https://github.com/moses-smt/ mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/ generic/multi-bleu.perl 5 The authors of (Bahdanau et al, 2015) gave us access to their trained models. We chose the best one on the validation set and resumed training. 15k and 30k for English?French, and 15k and 50k for English?German. We later report the results for thebest performance on the development set, with models generally evaluated every twelve hours. The training speed is approximately the same as for RNNsearch. Using a 780 Ti or Titan Black GPU, we could process 100k mini-batches of 80 sentences in about 29 and 39 hours respectively for ? = 15k and ? = 50k. For both language pairs, we also trained new models, with ? = 15k and ? = 50k, by reshuffling the dataset at the beginning of each epoch. While this causes a non-negligible amount of overhead, such a change allows words to be contrasted with different sets of other words each epoch. To stabilize parameters other than the word embeddings, at the end of the training stage, we freeze the word embeddings and tune only the other parameters for approximately two more days after the peak performance on the development set is observed. This helped increase BLEU scores on the development set. We use beam search to generate a translation given a source. During beam search, we keep a set of 12 hypotheses and normalize probabilities by the length of the candidate sentences, as in (Cho et al, 2014a). 6 The candidate list is chosen to maximize the performance on the development set, for K ? {15k, 30k, 50k} and K ? ? {10, 20}. As explained in Sec. 3.2, we test using a bilingual dictionary to accelerate decoding and to replace unknown words in translations. The bilingual dictionary is built using fast align (Dyer et al., 2013). We use the dictionary only if a word starts with a lowercase letter, and otherwise, we copy the source word directly. This led to better performance on the development sets. Note on ensembles For each language pair, we began training four models from each of which two points corresponding to the best and secondbest performance on the development set were collected. We continued training from each point, while keeping the word embeddings fixed, until the best development performance was reached, and took the model at this point as a single model in an ensemble. This procedure resulted in a total of eight models from which we averaged the length-normalized log-probabilities. Since much of training had been shared, the composition of 6 These experimental details differ from (Bahdanau et al, 2015). 6 RNNsearch RNNsearch-LV Google Phrase-based SMT Basic NMT 29.97 (26.58) 32.68 (28.76) 30.6 ? 33.3 ? 37.03 ? +Candidate List ? 33.36 (29.32) ? +UNK Replace 33.08 (29.08) 34.11 (29.98) 33.1 ? +Reshuffle (?=50k) ? 34.60 (30.53) ? +Ensemble ? 37.19 (31.98) 37.5 ?

RNNsearch is the model proposed in (Bahdanau et al, 2015), RNNsearch-LV is the RNNsearch trained with the approach proposed in this paper, and Google is the LSTM-based model proposed in (Sutskever et al,2014). Unless mentioned otherwise, we report singlemodel RNNsearch-LV scores using ? = 30k (English?French) and ? = 50k (English?German). For the experiments we have run ourselves, we show the scores on the development set as well in the brackets. (?) (Sutskever et al, 2014), (?) (Luong et al, 2015), (?) (Durrani et al, 2014), (?) Standard Moses Setting (Cho et al, 2014b), (\\x05) (Buck et al, 2014). such ensembles may be sub-optimal. This is supported by the fact that higher cross-model BLEU scores (Freitag et al, 2014) are observed for models that were partially trained together. 4.2 Translation Performance In Table 2, we present the results obtained by the trained models with very large target vocabularies, and alongside them, the previous results reported in (Sutskever et al, 2014), (Luong et al, 2015), (Buck et al, 2014) and (Durrani et al, 2014). Without translation-specific strategies, we can clearly see that the RNNsearch-LV outperforms the baseline RNNsearch. In the case of the English?French task, RNNsearch-LV approached the performance level of the previous best single neural machine translation (NMT) model, even without any translationspecific techniques (Sec. 3.2?3.3). With these, however, the RNNsearch-LV outperformed it. The performance of the RNNsearch-LV is also better than that of a standard phrase-based translation system (Cho et al, 2014b). Furthermore, by combining 8 models, we were able to achieve a translation performance comparable to the state of the art, measured in BLEU. For English?German, the RNNsearch-LV outperformed the baseline before unknown word replacement, but after doing so, the two systems performed similarly. We could reach higher largevocabulary single-model performance by reshuffling the dataset, but this step could potentially also help the baseline. In this case, we were able to surpass the previously reported best translation result on this task by building an ensemble of 8 models. With ? = 15k, the RNNsearch-LV performance worsened a little, with best BLEU scores, without reshuffling, of 33.76 and 18.59 respectively for English?French and English?German. The English?German ensemble described in this paper has also been used for the shared translation task of the 10 th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT?15), where it was ranked first in terms of BLEU score. The translations by this ensemble can be found online. 7 4.3 Analysis 4.3.1 Decoding Speed In Table 3, we present the timing information of decoding for different models. Clearly, decoding from RNNsearch-LV with the full target vocab7 http://matrix.statmt.org/matrix/ output/1774?run_id=4079 7 CPU ? GPU ?

GTX TITAN Black ulary is slowest. If we use a candidate list for decoding each translation, the speed of decoding substantially improves and becomes close to the baseline RNNsearch. A potential issue with using a candidate list is that for each source sentence, we must re-build a target vocabulary andsubsequently replace a part of the parameters, which may easily become timeconsuming. We can address this issue, for instance, by building a common candidate list for multiple source sentences. By doing so, we were able to match the decoding speed of the baseline RNNsearch model. 4.3.2 Decoding Target Vocabulary For English?French (? = 30k), we evaluate the influence of the target vocabulary when translating the test sentences by using the union of a fixed set of 30k common words and (at most) K ? likely candidates for each source word according to the dictionary. Results are presented in Figure 1. With K ? = 0 (not shown), the performance of the system is comparable to the baseline when not replacing the unknown words (30.12), but there is not as much improvement when doing so (31.14). As the large vocabulary model does not predict [UNK] as much during training, it is less likely to generate it when decoding, limiting the effectiveness of the post-processing step in this case. With K ? = 1, which limits the diversity of allowed uncommon words, BLEU is not as good as with moderately larger K ? , which indicates that our models can, to some degree, correctly choose between rare alternatives. If we rather use K = 50k, as we did for testing based on validation performance, the improvement over K ? = 1 is approximately 0.2 BLEU. When validating the choice of K, we found it to be correlated with the value of ? used during 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 K? 32.8 33.0 33.2 33.4 33.6 33.8 34.0 34.2 B L E U s c o r e With UNK replacement Without UNK replacement Figure 1: Single-model test BLEU scores (English?French) with respect to the number of dictionary entries K ? allowed for each source word. training. For example, on the English?French validation set, with ? = 15k (and K ? = 10), the BLEU score is 29.44 with K = 15k, but drops to 29.19 and 28.84 respectively for K = 30k and 50k. For ? = 30k, the score increases moderately from K = 15k to K = 50k. A similar effect was observed for English?German and on the test sets. As our implementation of importance sampling does not apply the usual correction to the gradient, it seems beneficial for the test vocabularies to resemble those used during training.5 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a way to extend the size of the target vocabulary for neural machine translation. The proposed approach allows us to train a model with much larger target vocabulary without any substantial increase in computational complexity. It is based on the earlier work in (Bengio and S?en?ecal, 2008) which used importance sampling to reduce the complexity of computing the normalization constant of the output word probability in neural language models. On English?French and English?German translation tasks, we observed that the neural machine translation models trained using the proposed method performed as well as, or better than, those using only limited sets of target words, even when replacing unknown words. As performance of the RNNsearch-LV models increased when only a selected subset of the target vocabulary was used during decoding, this makes the proposed learning algorithm more practical. When measured by BLEU, our models showed translation performance comparable to the 8 state-of-the-art translation systems on both the English?French task and English?German task. On the English?French task, a model trained with the proposed approach outperformed the best single neural machine translation (NMT) model from (Luong et al, 2015) by approximately 1 BLEU point. The performance of the ensemble of multiple models, despite its relatively less diverse composition, is approximately 0.3 BLEU points away from the best system (Luong et al, 2015). On the English?German task, the best performance of 21.59 BLEU by our model is higher than that of the previous state of the art (20.67) reported in (Buck et al, 2014). Finally, we release the source code used in our experiments to encourage progress in neural machine translation. 8 Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the developers of Theano (Bergstra et al, 2010; Bastien et al, 2012).

       "  b'1 In t roduct ion   Parallel texts have been used in a number of studies  in computational linguistics. Brown et al (1993)  defined a series of probabilistic translation models  for MT purposes. While people may question the  effectiveness of using these models for a full-blown  MT system, the models are certainly valuable for de-  veloping translation assistance tools. For example,  we can use such a translation model to help com-  plete target ext being drafted by a human transla-  tor (Langlais et al, 2000).  Another utilization is in cross-language informa-  tion retrieval (CLIR) where queries have to be trans-  lated from one language to another language in  which the documents are written. In CLIR, the qual-  ity requirement for translation is relatively low. For  example, the syntactic aspect is irrelevant. Even if  the translated word is not a true translation but is  strongly related to the original query, it is still help-  ful. Therefore, CLIR is a suitable application for  such a translation model.  However, a major obstacle to this approach is the  lack of parallel corpora for model training. Only  a few such corpora exist, including the Hansard  English-French corpus and the HKUST English-  Chinese corpus (Wu, 1994). In this paper, we will  describe a method which automatically searches for  parallel texts on the Web. We will discuss the text  mining algorithm we adopted, some issues in trans-  lation model training using the generated parallel  corpus, and finally the translation model\\'s perfor-  mance in CLIR.  2 Para l le l  Text  M in ing  A lgor i thm  The PTMiner system is an intelligent Web agent  that is designed to search for large amounts of paral-  lel text on the Web. The mining algorithm is largely  language independent. It can thus be adapted to  other language pairs with only minor modifications.  Taking advantage ofWeb search engines as much  as possible, PTMiner implements he following steps  (illustrated in Fig. 1):  1 Search for candidate sites - Using existing Web  search engines, search for the candidate sites  that may contain parallel pages;  2 File name fetching - For each candidate site,  fetch the URLs of Web pages that are indexed  by the search engines;  3 Host crawling - Starting from the URLs col-  lected in the previous tep, search through each  candidate site separately for more URLs;  4 Pair scan - From the obtained URLs of each  site, scan for possible parallel pairs;  5 Download and verifying - Download the parallel  pages, determine file size, language, and charac-  ter set of each page, and filter out non-parallel  pairs.  2.1 Search for candidate Sites  We take advantage of the huge number of Web sites  indexed by existing search engines in determining candidate sites. This is done by submitting some  particular equests to the search engines. The re-  quests are determined according to the following ob-  servations. In the sites where parallel text exists,  there are normally some pages in one language con-  taining links to the parallel version in the other lan-  guage. These are usually indicated by those links\\'  anchor texts 1. For example, on some English page  there may be a link to its Chinese version with  the anchor text \"Chinese Version\" or \"in Chinese\".  1An anchor text  is a piece of text on a Web page which,  when clicked on, will take you to another linked page. To  be helpful, it usual ly  contains the key information about the  l inked page.  21  Figure 1: The workflow of the mining process.  The same phenomenon can be observed on Chinese  pages. Chances are that a site with parallel texts  will contain such links in some of its documents.  This fact is used as the criterion in searching for  candidate sites.  Therefore, to determine possible sites for English-  Chinese parallel texts, we can request an English  document containing the following anchor:  anchor : \"engl ish version H \\\\[\"in english\", ...\\\\].  Similar requests are sent for Chinese documents.  From the two sets of pages obtained by the above  queries we extract wo sets of Web sites. The union  of these two sets constitutes then the candidate sites.  That  is to say, a site is a candidate site when it  is found to have either an English page linking to  its Chinese version or a Chinese page linking to its  English version.  2.2 File Name Fetching  We now assume that a pair of parallel texts exists on  the same site. To search for parallel pairs on a site,  PTMiner first has to obtain all (or at least part of)  the HTML file names on the site. From these names  pairs are scanned. It is possible to use a Web crawler  to explore the candidate sites completely. However,  we can take advantage of the search engines again to  accelerate the process. As the first step, we submit  the following query to the search engines:  host : hostname  to fetch the Web pages that they indexed from this  site. If we only require a small amount of parallel  texts, this result may be sufficient. For our purpose,  however, we need to explore the sites more thor-  oughly using a host crawler. Therefore, we continue  our search for files with a host crawler which uses  the documents found by the search engines as the  starting point.  2.3 Host Crawling  A host crawler is slightly different from a Web  crawler. Web crawlers go through innumerable  pages and hosts on theWeb. A host crawler is a  Web crawler that crawls through documents on a  given host only. A breadth-first crawling algorithm  is applied in PTMiner as host crawler. The principle  is that when a link to an unexplored ocument on  the same site is found in a document, it is added to  a list that will be explored later. In this way, most  file names from the candidate sites are obtained.  2.4 Pair Scan  After collecting file names for each candidate site,  the next task is to determine the parallel pairs.  Again, we try to use some heuristic rules to guess  which files may be parallel texts before downloading  them. The rules are based on external features of  the documents. By external feature, we mean those  features which may be known without analyzing the  contents of the file, such as its URL, size, and date.  This is in contrast with the internal features, such as  language, character set, and HTML structure, which  cannot be known until we have downloaded the page  and analyzed its contents.  The heuristic criterion comes from the following  observation: We observe that parallel text pairs usu-  ally have similar name patterns. The difference be-  tween the names of two parailel pages usually lies  in a segment which indicates the language. For ex-  ample, \"file-ch.html\" (in Chinese) vs. \"file-en.html\"  (in English). The difference may also appear in the  path, such as \".../chinese/.../fi le.html\" vs. \".../en-  glish/.../f i le.html\\'. The name patterns described  above are commonly used by webmasters to help or-  ganize their sites. Hence, we can suppose that a  pair of pages with this kind of pattern are probably  parallel texts.  22 First, we establish four lists for English pre-  fixes, English suffixes, Chinese prefixes and Chi-  nese suffixes. For example: Engl ish P re f ix  =  {e, en, e_, en_, e - ,  en - ,  ...}. For each file in one lan-  guage, if a segment in its name corresponds to one  of the language affixes, several new names are gener-  ated by changing the segment to the possible corre-  sponding affixes of the other language. If a generated  name corresponds to an existing file, then the file is  considered as a candidate parallel document of the  original file.  2.5 Filtering  Next, we further examine the contents of the paired  files to determine if they are really parallel according  to various external and internal features. This may  further improve the pairing precision. The following  methods have been implemented in our system.  2.5.1 Text Length  Parallel files often have similar file lengths. One sim-  ple way to filter out incorrect pairs is to compare  the lengths of the two files. The only problem is to  set a reasonablethreshold that will not discard too  many good pairs, i.e. balance recall and precision.  The usual difference ratio depends on the language  pairs we are dealing with. For example, Chinese-  English parallel texts usually have a larger differ-  ence ratio than English-French parallel texts. The  filtering threshold had to be determined empirically,  from the actual observations. For Chinese-English,  a difference up to 50% is tolerated.  2.5.2 Language and  Character Set  It is also obvious that the two files of a pair have  to be in the two languages of interest. By auto-  matically identifying language and character set, we  can filter out the pairs that do not satisfy this basic  criterion. Some Web pages explicitly indicate the  language and the character set. More often such  information is omitted by authors. We need some  language identification tool for this task.  SILC is a language and encoding identification  system developed by the RALI laboratory at the  University of Montreal. It employs a probabilistic  model estimated on tri-grams. Using these mod-  els, the system is able to determine the most proba-  ble language and encoding of a text (Isabelle et al,  1997).  2.5.3 HTML Structure and Alignment  In the STRAND system (Resnik, 1998), the candi-  date pairs are evaluated by aligning them according  to their HTML structures and computing confidence  values. Pairs are assumed to be wrong if they have  too many mismatching markups or low confidence  values.  Comparing HTML structures seems to be a sound  way to evaluate candidate pairs since parallel pairs  usually have similar HTML structures. However, we  also noticed that parallel texts may have quite dif-  ferent HTML structures. One of the reasons is that  the two files may be created using two HTML ed-  itors. For example, one may be used for English  and another for Chinese, depending on the language  handling capability of the editors. Therefore, cau-  tion is required when measuring structure difference  numerically.  Parallel text alignment is still an experimental  area. Measuring the confidence values of an align-  ment is even more complicated. For example, the  alignment algorithm we used in the training of the  statistical translation model produces acceptable  alignment results but it does not provide a confi-  dence value that we can \"confidently\" use as an eval-  uation criterion. So, for the moment his criterion is  not used in candidate pair evaluation.  3 Generated  Corpus  and Trans la t ion   Mode l  Tra in ing   In this section, we describe the results of our parallel  text mining and translation model training.  3.1 The Corpus  Using the above approach for Chinese-English, 185  candidate sites were searched from the domain hk.  We limited the mining domain to hk because Hong  Kongis a bilingual English-Chinese city where high  quality parallel Web sites exist. Because of the small  number of candidate sites, the host crawler was used  to thoroughly explore each site. The resulting cor-  pus contains 14820 pairs of texts including 117.2Mb  Chinese texts and 136.5Mb English texts. The entire  mining process lasted about a week. Using length  comparison and language identification, we refined  the precision of the corpus to about 90%. The preci-  sion is estimated by examining 367 randomly picked  pairs.  3.2 Statistical Translation Model  Many approaches in computational linguistics try to  extract ranslation knowledge from previous trans-  lation examples. Most work of this kind establishes  probabilistic models from parallel corpora. Based  on one of the statistical models proposed by Brown  et al (1993), the basic principle of our translation  model is the following: given a corpus of aligned sen-  tences, if two words often co-occur in the source and  target sentences, there is a good likelihood that they  are translations of each other. In the simplest case  (model 1), the model earns the probability, p(tls), of  having a word t in the translation of a sentence con-  taining a word s. For an input sentence, the model  then calculates a sequence of words that are most  probable to appear in its translation. Using a sim-  ilar statistical model, Wu (1995) extracted a large-  scale English-Chinese l xicon from the HKUST cor-  23   <s id=\"00~\">  <HTML> <HEAD>  <META HTrP-EQUIV=\"Content-type\"  CONTENT=\"text/html; charset--iso-8859-1\">  <META HTI\\'P-EQUIV=\"Content-language\"  CONTENT=\"Western\">  </s>  <s id=\"0001\">  <TITLE>Journal of Primary Education 1996,  VoI., No. l&2, pp. 19-27 </TITLE>  </HEAD>  </s>  <s id=\"0002\">  <BODY BACKGROUND=\".Jgif/pejbg.jpg\"  TEXT=\"#000(3(O\" BGCOLOR=\"#ffffff\">  <CENTER>  </s>  <s id=\"0003\">  <HI>Journal of Primary Education </HI>  </s>  <s id=\"0004\">  <HR> <B>Volume 6, No l&2, pp. 19-27 (May,  1996) </B> <HR>  </s>  <s id=\"0005\">  <H3>Principles for Redesigning Teacher  Education </H3> Alan TOM </CENTER>  </s>  <s id=\"0006\">  <P> <B> <I> Abstract </I> </B>  </s>  <s id=\"0000\">  <HTML> <HEAD>  <META H\\'ITP-EQUW=\"Content-type\"  CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=bigS\">  <META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-language\"  CONTENT=\"zh\">  <Is>  <s id=\"0001\">  <TITLE> Journal of Primary Education 1996,  Vol., No. l&2, Page 19-27 </TITLE>  </HEAD>  </s>  <s id=\"0002\">  <BODY BACKGROUND=\".Jgif/pejbg.jpg\"  TEXT=\"#000000\" BGCOLOR=\"#ffffff\"> <A  HREF=\"/erdpej/b2g__pej.phtml?URL=%2fen%2fp  ej%2f0601%2f0601019c.htm\">  <IMG SRC=\"/en/gif/kan.gif\" ALT=\"~\"   BORDER=0 ALIGN=R IGHT> </A> <CENTER>  </s>  <s id=\"0003\">  <H2>~ ~ 11I ~ O.</H2>  </s>  <s id=\"0004\">  <HR> (~:~h-fv-c?.JLJl) ~,-\\\\]\\'?~..  </s>  <s id=\"0005\">  ~ 19-27\\\\]~ <I-1R>  </s>  Figure 2: An alignment example using pure length-based method.  pus which is built manually. In our case, the prob-  abilistic translation model will be used for CLIR.  The requirement on our translation model may be  less demanding: itis not absolutely necessary that  a word t with high p(tls ) always be a true trans-  lation of s. It is still useful if t is strongly related  to s. For example, although \"railway\" is not a true  translation of \"train\" (in French), it is highly useful  to include \"railway\" in the translation of a query on  \"train\". This is one of the reasons why we think a  less controlled parallel corpus can be used to train a  translation model for CLIR.  3.3 Parallel Text Al ignment  Before the mined documents can be aligned into par-  allel sentences, the raw texts have to undergo a se-  ries of some preprocessing, which, to some extent, is  language dependent. For example, the major opera-  tions on the Chinese-English corpus include encod-  ing scheme transformation (for Chinese), sentence  level segmentation, parallel text alignment, Chinese  word segmentation (Nie et al, 1999) and English  expression extraction.  The parallel Web pages we collected from vari-  ous sites are not all of the same quality. Some are  highly parallel and easy to align while others can be  very noisy. Aligning English-Chinese parallel texts  is already very difficult because of the great differ-  ences in the syntactic structures and writing sys-  tems of the two languages. A number of alignment  techniques have been proposed, varying from statis-  tical methods (Brown et al, 1991; Gale and Church,  1991) to lexical methods (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993;  Chen, 1993). The method we adopted is that of  Simard et al (1992). Because it considers both  length similarity and cognateness as alignment cri-  teria, the method is more robust and better able  to deal with noise than pure length-based methods.  Cognates are identical sequences of characters in cor-  responding words in two languages. They are com-  monly found in English and French. In the case of  English-Chinese alignment, where there are no cog-  nates shared by the two languages, only the HTML  markup in both texts are taken as cognates. Be-  cause the HTML structures of parallel pages are nor-  mally similar, the markup was found to be helpful  for alignment.  To illustrate how markup can help with the align-  ment, we align the same pair with both the pure  length-based method of Gale & Church (Fig. 2),  and the method of Simard et al (Fig. 3). First of  all, we observe from the figures that the two texts are  24 <s id=\"0000\">  <HTML> <HEAD>  <META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-type\"  CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 \">  <META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-language\"  CONTENT=\"Westem\">  </s>  <s id=\"0001\">  <TITLE>Journal of Primary Education 1996,  Vol., No. l&2, pp. 19-27 </TITLE>  </HEAD>  </s>  <s id=\"0002\">  <BODY BACKGROUND=-\".

The sentences are marked by  <s id=\"xxxx\"> and </s>.  Note that we determine  sentences not only by periods, but also by means of  HTML markup.  We further notice that it is difficult to align sen-  tences 0002. The sentence in the Chinese page is  much longer than its counterpart in the English page  because some additional information (font) is added.  The length-based method thus tends to take sen-  tence 0002, 0003, and 0004 in the English page as  the translation of sentence 0002 in the Chinese page  (Fig. 2), which is wrong. This in turn provocated  the three following incorrect alignments. As we can  see in Fig. 3, the cognate method did not make the  same mistake because of the noise in sentence 0002.  Despite their large length difference, the two 0002  sentences are still aligned as a 1-1 pair, because the  sentences in the following 4 alignments (0003 - 0003;  0004 - 0004, 0005; 0005 - 0006; 0006 - 0007) have  rather similar HTML markups and are taken by the  program to be the most likely alignments.  Beside HTML markups, other criteria may also  be incorporated. For example, it would be helpful  to consider strong correspondence b tween certain  English and Chinese words, as in (Wu, 1994). We  hope to implement such correspondences in our fu-  ture research.  3.4 Lex icon  Eva luat ion   To evaluate the precision of the English-Chinese  translation model trained on the Web corpus, we  examined two sample lexicons of 200 words, one in  each direction. The 200 words for each lexicon were  randomly selected from the training source. We ex-  amined the most probable translation for each word.  The Chinese-English lexicon was found to have a  precision of 77%. The English-Chinese l xicon has a higher precision of 81.5%. Part of the lexicons  are shown in Fig. 4, where t / f  indicates whether a  translation is true or false.  These precisions seem to be reasonably high.  They are quite comparable to that obtained by Wu  (1994) using a manual Chinese-English parallel cor-  pus.  3.5 Effect  o f  S topwords   We also found that stop-lists have significant effect  on the translation model.

More importantly, their ex-  istence greatly affects the accuracy of other transla-  tions. They can be taken as translations for many  words.  A priori, it would seem that both the English and  Chinese stop-lists hould be applied to eliminate the  noise caused by them. Interestingly, from our ob-  servation and analysis we concluded that for better  precision, only the stop-list of the target language  should be applied in the model training.  We first explain why the stop-list of the target lan-  guage has to be applied. On the left side of Fig. 5,  if the Chinese word C exists in the same alignments  with the English word E more than any other Chi-  nese words, C will be the most probable translation  for E. Because of their frequent appearance, some  Chinese stopwords may have more chances tobe in  the same alignments with E. The probability of the  translation E --+ C is then reduced (maybe ven less  than those of the incorrect ones). This is the reason  why many English words are translated to \"~ \\'  (of)  by the translation model trained without using the  Chinese stop-list.  We also found that it is not necessary to remove  the stopwords of the source language. In fact, as il-  lustrated on the right side of Fig. 5, the existence of  the English stopwords has two effects on the proba-  bility of the translation E -~ C:  1 They may often be found together with the Chi-  nese word C. Owing to the Expectation Maxi-  mization algorithm, the probability of E -~ C  may therefore be reduced.  2 On the other hand, there is a greater likelihood  that English stopwords will be found together  with the most frequent Chinese words. Here,  we use the term \"Chinese frequent words\" in-  stead of \"Chinese stopwords\" because ven if a  stop-list is applied, there may still remain some  common words that have the same effect as the  stopwords. The coexistence ofEnglish and Chi-  nese frequent words reduces the probability that  the Chinese frequent words are the translations  of E, and thus raise the probability of E -+ C.  The second effect was found to be more signifi-  cant than the first, since the model trained without  the English stopwords has better precision than the  model trained with the English stopwords. For the  correct ranslations given by both models, the model  26 Mono-Lingual IR  Translation Model  Dictionary  C-E CLIR  0.3861  0.1504 (39.0%mono)  0.1530 (39.6%mono)  0.2583 (66.9%mono)  E-C CLIR  0.3976  0.1841 (46.3%mono)  0.1427 (35.9%mono)  0.2232 (56.1%mono)  Table 1: CLIR results.  trained without considering the English stopwords  gives higher probabilities.  4 Eng l i sh -Ch inese  CL IR  Resu l ts   Our final goal was to test the performance of the  translation models trained on the Web parallel cor-  pora in CLIR. We conducted CLIR experiments u -  ing the Smart IR system.  4.1 Results   The English test corpus (for C-E CLIR) was the  AP corpus used in TREC6 and TREC7. The short  English queries were translated manually into Chi-  nese and then translated back to English by the  translation model. The Chinese test corpus was the  one used in the TREC5 and TREC6 Chinese track.  It contains both Chinese queries and their English  translations.  Our experiments on these two corpora produced  the results hown in Tab. 1. The precision of mono-  lingual IR is given as benchmark. In both E-C and  C-E CLIR, the translation model achieved around  40% of monolingual precision. To comparewith the  dictionary-based approach, we employed a Chinese-  English dictionary, CEDICT (Denisowski, 1999),  and an English-Chinese online dictionary (Anony-  mous, 1999a) to translate queries. For each word  of the source query, all the possible translations  given by the dictionary are included in the translated  query. The Chinese-English dictionary has about  the same performace as the translation model, while  the English-Chinese dictionary has lower precision  than that of the translation model.  We also tried to combine the translations given by  the translation model and the dictionary. In both  C-E and E-C CLIR, significant improvements were  achieved (as shown in Tab. 1). The improvements  show that the translations given by the translation  model and the dictionary complement each other  well for IR purposes. The translation model may  give either exact ranslations orincorrect but related  words. Even though these words are not correct in  the sense of translation, they are very possibly re-  lated to the subject of the query and thus helpful  for IR purposes. The dictionary-based approach ex-  pands a query along another dimension. It gives  all the possible translations for each word including  those that are missed by the translation model.  4.2 Comparison Wi th  MT Systems  One advantage of a parallel text-based translation  model is that it is easier to build than an MT system.  Now that we have examined the CLIR performance  of the translation model, we will compare it with  two existing MT systems. Both systems were tested  in E-C CLIR.  4.2.1 Sunshine WebTran Server  Using the Sunshine WebTran server (Anonymous,  1999b), an online Engiish-Chinese MT system, to  translate the 54 English queries, we obtained an  average precision of 0.2001, which is 50.3% of the  mono-lingual precision. The precision is higher than  that obtained using the translation model (0.1804)  or the dictionary (0.1427) alone, but lower than the  precison obtained using them together (0.2232).  4.2.2 Transperfect  Kwok (1999) investigated the CLIR performance of an English-Chinese MT software called Transper-  fect, using the same TREC Chinese collection as we  used in this study. Using the MT software alone,  Kwok achieved 56% of monolingual precision. The  precision is improved to 62% by refining the trans-  lation with a dictionary. Kwok also adopted pre-  translation query expansion, which further improved  the precison to 70% of the monolingual results.  In our case, the best E-C CLIR precison using the  translation model (and dictionary) is 56.1%. It is  lower than what Kwok achieved using Transperfect,  however, the difference is not large.  4.3 Further  Problems  The Chinese-English translation model has a fax  lower CLIR performance than that of the English-  French model established using the same method  (Nie et al, 1999). The principal reason for this is the  fact that English and Chineseare much more differ-  ent than English and French. This problem surfaced  in many phases of this work, from text alignment to  query translation. Below, we list some further fac-  tors affecting CLIR precision.  ? The Web-collected corpus is noisy and it is dif-  ficult to align English-Chinese t xts. The align-  ment method we employed has performed more  poorly than on English-French alignment. This  in turn leads to poorer performance of the trans-  lation model. In general, we observe a higher  27  variability in Chinese-English translations than  in English-French translations.  ? For E-C CLIR, although queries in both lan-  guages were provided, the English queries were  not strictly translated from the original Chi-  nese ones. For example, A Jg ,~ (human right  situation) was translated into human right is-  sue. We cannot expect he translation model  to translate issue back to ~ (situation).  ? The training source and the CLIR collections  were from different domains. The Web cor-  pus are retrieved from the parallel sites in Hong  Kong while the Chinese collection is from Peo-  ple\\'s Daily and Xinhua News Agency, which are  published in mainland China. As the result,  some important erms such as ~$ $ (most-  favored-nation) and --- I!! ~ ~ (one-nation-two-  systems) in the collection are not known by the  model.  5 Summary   The goal of this work was to investigate he feasibil-  ity of using a statistical translation model trained on  a Web-collected corpus to do English-Chinese CLIR.  In this paper, we have described the algorithm and  implementation we used for parallel text mining,  translation model training, and some results we ob-  tained in CLIR experiments. Although further work  remains to be done, we can conclude that it is pos-  sible to automatically construct a Chinese-English  parallel corpus from the Web. The current system  can be easily adapted to other language pairs. De-  spite the noisy nature of the corpus and the great  difference in the languages, the evaluation lexicons  generated by the translation model produced accept-  able precision. While the current CLIR results are  not as encouraging asthose of English-French CLIR,  they could be improved in various ways, such as im-  proving the alignment method by adapting cognate  definitions to HTML markup, incorporating a lexi-  con and/or removing some common function words  in translated queries.  We hope to be able to demonstrate in the near  future that a fine-tuned English-Chinese translation  model can provide query translations for CLIR with  the same quality produced by MT systems.
